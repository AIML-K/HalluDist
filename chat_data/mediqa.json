            "knowledge": "Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome: Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a rare disease passed down through families. The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through the intestines. Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by a defect in a gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with protein). The defect makes it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins.   It is an autosomal recessive condition that more often affects males. Symptoms include:     - Balance and coordination difficulties   - Curvature of spine   - Decreased vision that gets worse over time   - Developmental delay   - Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy   - Muscle weakness   - Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10   - Protruding abdomen   - Slurred speech   - Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools There may be damage to the retina of the eye (retinitis pigmentosa).   Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include:     - Apolipoprotein B blood test   - Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K)   - \"Burr-cell\" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis)   - Complete blood count (CBC)   - Cholesterol studies   - Electromyography   - Eye exam   - Nerve conduction velocity   - Stool sample analysis      Genetic testing may be available for mutations in the MTP gene. Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K).   Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended.   People with this condition should talk to a nutritionist. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This involves:     - Limiting fat intake to 5 to 20 grams per day.   - Do not eat more than 5 ounces daily (140 grams) of lean meat, fish, or poultry.   - Use skim milk instead of whole milk.      Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage. How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems. Complications may include:     - Blindness   - Mental deterioration   - Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia) Call your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person. High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.

            "knowledge": "abetalipoproteinemia: Abetalipoproteinemia is an inherited disorder that affects the absorption of dietary fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. People affected by this disorder are not able to make certain lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood. Specifically, people with abetalipoproteinemia are missing a group of lipoproteins called beta-lipoproteins. An inability to make beta-lipoproteins causes severely reduced absorption (malabsorption) of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Sufficient levels of fats, cholesterol, and vitamins are necessary for normal growth, development, and maintenance of the body's cells and tissues, particularly nerve cells and tissues in the eye.   The signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia appear in the first few months of life. They can include failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); diarrhea; abnormal star-shaped red blood cells (acanthocytosis); and fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea). Other features of this disorder may develop later in childhood and often impair the function of the nervous system. Disturbances in nerve function may cause affected people to eventually develop poor muscle coordination and difficulty with balance and movement (ataxia). Individuals with this condition may also develop an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, in which progressive degeneration of the light-sensitive layer (retina) at the back of the eye can cause vision loss. Adults in their thirties or forties may have increasing difficulty with balance and walking. Many of the signs and symptoms of abetalipoproteinemia result from a severe vitamin deficiency, especially a deficiency of vitamin E. Abetalipoproteinemia is a rare disorder with approximately 100 cases described worldwide. Mutations in the MTTP gene cause abetalipoproteinemia. The MTTP gene provides instructions for making a protein called microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which is essential for creating beta-lipoproteins. These lipoproteins are necessary for the absorption of fats, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet and the efficient transport of these substances in the bloodstream. Most of the mutations in the MTTP gene lead to the production of an abnormally short microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, which prevents the normal creation of beta-lipoproteins in the body. A lack of beta-lipoproteins causes the nutritional and neurological problems seen in people with abetalipoproteinemia. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

Treatments for mild thalassemia Signs and symptoms are usually mild with thalassemia minor and little, if any, treatment is needed. Occasionally, you may need a blood transfusion, particularly after surgery, after having a baby or to help manage thalassemia complications. People with severe beta-thalassemia will need blood transfusions. And because this treatment can cause iron overload, they will also need treatment to remove excess iron. An oral medication called deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu) can help remove the excess iron. Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia Treatments for moderate to severe thalassemia may include: - Frequent blood transfusions. More-severe forms of thalassemia often require frequent blood transfusions, possibly every few weeks. Over time, blood transfusions cause a buildup of iron in your blood, which can damage your heart, liver and other organs. To help your body get rid of the extra iron, you may need to take medications that rid your body of extra iron. - Stem cell transplant. Also called a bone marrow transplant, a stem cell transplant may be an option in select cases, including children born with severe thalassemia. It can eliminate the need for lifelong blood transfusions and drugs to control iron overload. During this procedure, you receive infusions of stem cells from a compatible donor, usually a sibling.",

            "knowledge": "Absence seizure: An absence seizure is the term for a type of seizure involving staring spells. This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) disturbance of brain function due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 6 to 12.   In some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates).   They may occur with other types of seizures, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (myoclonus), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures). Most absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes. The episodes may:     - Occur many times a day   - Occur for weeks to months before being noticed   - Interfere with school and learning   - Be mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior      Unexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures.   During the seizure, the person may:     - Stop walking and start again a few seconds later   - Stop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later      The person usually does not fall during the seizure.    Right after the seizure, the person is usually:     - Wide awake   - Thinking clearly   - Unaware of the seizure      Specific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include:     - Changes in muscle activity, such as no movement, hand fumbling, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing   - Changes in alertness (consciousness), such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities     Some absence seizures begin slower and last longer. These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable. The doctor will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system.   An EEG (electroencephalogram) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.   Blood tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures.   Head CT or MRI scan may be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Treatment for absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for adults and children, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.

Women have two X chromosomes and are the carriers of the disease, but since men only have one X chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra X chromosome, they are more severely affected. People with X-ALD accumulate high levels of saturated, very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in the brain and adrenal cortex. The loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of X-ALD. While nearly all patients with X-ALD suffer from adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood. The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. The milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), which typically begins between ages 21 and 35. Symptoms may include progressive stiffness, weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs, and ataxia. Although adult-onset ALD progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form, it can also result in deterioration of brain function. Almost half the women who are carriers of X-ALS will develop a milder form of AMN but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the X-ALD. X-ALD should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy, which is a disease of newborns and young infants and belongs to the group of peroxisomal biogenesis disorders.",

The condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body.    There are 3 major categories of disease:     - Childhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8)   - Adrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life   - Impaired adrenal gland function (called Addison disease or Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones Childhood cerebral type symptoms include:     - Changes in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements   - Crossed eyes   - Handwriting that gets worse   - Difficulty at school   - Difficulty understanding what people are saying   - Hearing loss   - Hyperactivity   - Worsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis    - Seizures   - Swallowing difficulties   - Visual impairment or blindness     Adrenomyelopathy symptoms include:     - Difficulty controlling urination   - Possible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness   - Problems with thinking speed and visual memory     Adrenal gland failure (Addison type) symptoms include:     - Coma   - Decreased appetite   - Increased skin color   - Loss of weight and muscle mass (wasting)   - Muscle weakness   - Vomiting Tests for this condition include:     - Blood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland   - Chromosome study to look for changes (mutations) in the ABCD1 gene   - MRI of the head Adrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones.   A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure a people of the condition. The childhood form of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is a progressive disease. It leads to a long-term coma (vegetative state) about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop. The child can live in this condition for as long as 10 years until death occurs.   The other forms of this disease are milder. These complications can occur:     - Adrenal crisis   - Vegetative state Call your health care provider if:     - Your child develops symptoms of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy   - Your child has X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and is getting worse Genetic counseling is recommended for couples with a family history of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. Mothers of affected sons have an 85% chance of being a carrier for this condition.   Prenatal diagnosis of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is also available. It is done by testing cells from chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. These tests look for either a known genetic change in the family or for very long chain fatty acid levels.

These gene mutations cause a shortage (deficiency) of a protein  called adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP).  A deficiency of this protein leads to an abnormally high level of fat molecules called very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) to build up in the body.  High levels of VLCFA may be toxic to the adrenal cortex and myelin.   There are several forms of X-ALD including: a childhood cerebral form, an adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) type, and an adrenal insufficiency-only type. Another form of ALD is occasionally seen in women who are carriers of the condition [1] A specific treatment for X-ALD is not currently available, but eating a diet low in VLCFA and taking special oils can lower the blood levels of VLCFA.  Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be an option for boys and adolescents in early stages who have evidence of brain involvement on MRI . [2]  Adrenocortical insufficiency is treated with cortisone replacement.",

Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence.",

            "knowledge": "Anal fissure (Diagnosis): If possible, your doctor will perform a digital rectal exam, which involves inserting a gloved finger into your anal canal, or use a short, lighted tube (anoscope) to inspect your anal canal. However, if this is too painful for you, your doctor may be able to diagnose an anal fissure only by observation. An acute anal fissure looks like a fresh tear, somewhat like a paper cut. A chronic anal fissure likely has the tear, as well as two separate lumps or tags of skin, one internal (sentinel pile) and one external (hypertrophied papilla). The fissure's location offers clues about its cause. A fissure that occurs on the side of the anal opening, rather than the back or front, is more likely to be a sign of another disorder, such as Crohn's disease. Your doctor may recommend further testing if he or she thinks you have an underlying condition: - Flexible sigmoidoscopy. Your doctor will insert a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video into the bottom portion of your colon. This test may be done if you're younger than 50 and have no risk factors for intestinal diseases or colon cancer. - Colonoscopy. Your doctor will insert a flexible tube into your rectum to inspect the entire colon.

            "knowledge": "Angelman syndrome: Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood.   Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual.   With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as \"coarse.\" Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal. Angelman syndrome affects an estimated 1 in 12,000 to 20,000 people. Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain.   Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 11 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene.   In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15.   The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases.   In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. However, loss of the OCA2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes. Most cases of Angelman syndrome are not inherited, particularly those caused by a deletion in the maternal chromosome 15 or by paternal uniparental disomy. These genetic changes occur as random events during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) or in early embryonic development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.   Rarely, a genetic change responsible for Angelman syndrome can be inherited. For example, it is possible for a mutation in the UBE3A gene or in the nearby region of DNA that controls gene activation to be passed from one generation to the next. Buiting K.

Because this cancer progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn't progress at all, some people prefer to wait to treat their cancer only if it causes signs and symptoms. The majority of people with hairy cell leukemia eventually need treatment. If your hairy cell leukemia causes signs and symptoms, you may decide to undergo treatment. There is no cure for hairy cell leukemia. But treatments are effective at putting hairy cell leukemia in remission for years. Chemotherapy Doctors consider chemotherapy drugs the first line of treatment for hairy cell leukemia. The great majority of people will experience complete or partial remission through the use of chemotherapy. Two chemotherapy drugs are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Cladribine. Treatment for hairy cell leukemia typically begins with cladribine. You receive a continuous infusion of the drug into a vein over several days. Most people who receive cladribine experience a complete remission that can last for several years. If your hairy cell leukemia returns, you can be treated with cladribine again. Side effects of cladribine may include infection and fever. - Pentostatin (Nipent). Pentostatin causes remission rates similar to cladribine, but it's given on a different schedule. People who take pentostatin receive infusions every other week for three to six months. Side effects of pentostatin may include fever, nausea and infection. Biological treatments Biological therapy attempts to make cancer cells more recognizable to your immune system. Once your immune system identifies cancer cells as intruders, it can set about destroying your cancer. Two types of biological treatments are used in hairy cell leukemia: - Interferon. Currently, the role of interferon in hairy cell leukemia treatment is limited. You might receive interferon if chemotherapy hasn't been effective or if you can't take chemotherapy. Most people experience partial remission with interferon, which is taken for a year. Side effects include flu-like symptoms, such as fever and fatigue. - Rituximab (Rituxan). Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, though it's sometimes used in hairy cell leukemia. If chemotherapy drugs haven't worked for you or you can't take chemotherapy, your doctor might consider rituximab. Side effects of rituximab include fever and infection. Surgery Surgery to remove your spleen (splenectomy) might be an option if your spleen ruptures or if it's enlarged and causing pain. Though removing your spleen can't cure hairy cell leukemia, it can usually restore normal blood counts. Splenectomy isn't commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia, but it may be helpful in certain situations. Any surgery carries a risk of bleeding and infection.",

Follow your doctor's instructions on taking medicines, eliminating asthma triggers, and monitoring symptoms.   MEDICINES FOR ASTHMA   There are two kinds of medicines for treating asthma:     - Control medicines to help prevent attacks   - Quick-relief (rescue) medicines for use during attacks     LONG-TERM MEDICINES   These are also called maintenance or control medicines. They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take them every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.   Some long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally). Your doctor will prescribe the right medicine for you.   QUICK-RELIEF MEDICINES   These are also called rescue medicines. They are taken:     - For coughing, wheezing, trouble breathing, or an asthma attack   - Just before exercising to help prevent asthma symptoms caused by exercise     Tell your doctor if you are using quick-relief medicines twice a week or more. If so, your asthma may not be under control and your doctor may need to change your dose of daily control drugs.   Quick-relief medicines include:     - Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators   - Oral corticosteroids for when you have an asthma attack that is not going away     A severe asthma attack requires a checkup by a doctor. You may also need a hospital stay. There, you will likely be given oxygen, breathing assistance, and medicines given through a vein (IV).

An asthma action plan should include:     - Instructions for taking asthma medicines when your condition is stable   - A list of asthma triggers and how to avoid them   - How to recognize when your asthma is getting worse, and when to call your provider     A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly you can move air out of your lungs.     - It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before symptoms appear. Peak flow measurements help let you know when you need to take medicine or other action.   - Peak flow values of 50% to 80% of your best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack. Numbers below 50% are a sign of a severe attack.",

Bacteria that build up in your mouth and between your teeth produce the bad odor. Other problems in your mouth, such as gum disease, dry mouth or cavities, may also cause it. Sinusitis or problems with your nose may be to blame. You can also have bad breath if you eat some foods, like raw onions, garlic or cabbage. And of course smoking causes its own bad aroma. Some diseases and medicines are associated with a specific breath odor.      Having good dental habits, like brushing and flossing regularly, help fight bad breath. Mouthwashes, mints or chewing gum may make your breath fresher. If you have an underlying disorder, treating it may help eliminate the breath odor.",

Further treatment for bad breath can vary, depending on the cause. If your bad breath is thought to be caused by an underlying health condition, your dentist will likely refer you to your primary care provider. For causes related to oral health, your dentist will work with you to help you better control that condition. Dental measures may include: - Mouth rinses and toothpastes. If your bad breath is due to a buildup of bacteria (plaque) on your teeth, your dentist may recommend a mouth rinse that kills the bacteria. Your dentist may also recommend a toothpaste that contains an antibacterial agent to kill the bacteria that cause plaque buildup. - Treatment of dental disease. If you have gum disease, you may be referred to a gum specialist (periodontist). Gum disease can cause gums to pull away from your teeth, leaving deep pockets that fill with odor-causing bacteria. Sometimes only professional cleaning removes these bacteria. Your dentist might also recommend replacing faulty tooth restorations, a breeding ground for bacteria.",

            "knowledge": "Generalized anxiety disorder: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental disorder in which a person is often worried or anxious about many things and finds it hard to control this anxiety. The cause of GAD is unknown. Genes may play a role. Stress may also contribute to the development of GAD.     GAD is a common condition. Anyone can develop this disorder, even children. GAD occurs more often in women than in men. The main symptom is frequent worry or tension for at least 6 months, even when there is little or no clear cause. Worries seem to float from one problem to another. Problems may involve family, other relationships, work, school, money, and health.     Even when aware that worries or fears are stronger than appropriate for the situation, a person with GAD still has difficulty controlling them.   Other symptoms of GAD include:     - Problems concentrating   - Fatigue   - Irritability   - Problems falling or staying asleep, or sleep that is restless and unsatisfying   - Restlessness when awake      The person may also have other physical symptoms. These can include muscle tension, upset stomach, sweating, or difficulty breathing. There is no test that can make a diagnosis of GAD. The diagnosis is based on your answers to questions about the symptoms of GAD. Your health care provider will ask about these symptoms. You will also be asked about other aspects of your mental and physical health. A physical exam or lab tests may be done to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms. The goal of treatment is to help you feel better and function well in daily life. Talk therapy or medicine alone can be helpful. Sometimes, a combination of these may work best.   TALK THERAPY    Many types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, behaviors, and symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:     - Understand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.   - Recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.   - Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.   - Avoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.      Other types of talk therapy may also be helpful in managing symptoms of an anxiety disorder.   MEDICINES    Certain medicines, usually used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider.   Medicines called sedatives or hypnotics may also be prescribed.     - These medicines should only be taken under a doctor's direction.   - Your doctor will prescribe a limited amount of these drugs. They should not to be used everyday.   - They may be used when symptoms become very severe or when you are about to be exposed to something that always brings on your symptoms.   - If you are prescribed a sedative, do not drink alcohol while on this medicine.      SELF-CARE   Other than taking medicine and going to therapy, you can help yourself get better by:     - Reducing caffeine   - Not using street drugs or large amounts of alcohol   - Exercising, getting enough rest, and eating healthy foods You can ease the stress of having GAD by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone. Support groups are usually not a good substitute for talk therapy or taking medicine, but can be a helpful addition.   Resources for more information include:   Anxiety and Depression Association of America: www.adaa.org   National Institute of Mental Health: www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders/index.shtml  How well a person does depends on how severe the condition is. In some cases, GAD is long-term and is difficult to treat. Most people, though, get better with medicine and/or talk therapy. Depression and substance abuse may occur with an anxiety disorder. Call your provider if you frequently worry or feel anxious, especially if it interferes with your daily activities. Updated by: Fred K.

            "knowledge": "Generalized anxiety disorder (Treatment): Treatment decisions are based on how significantly generalized anxiety disorder is affecting your ability to function in your daily life. The two main treatments for generalized anxiety disorder are psychotherapy and medications. You may benefit most from a combination of the two. It may take some trial and error to discover which treatments work best for you. Psychotherapy Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the most effective form of psychotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder. Generally a short-term treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on teaching you specific skills to directly manage your worries and help you gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety. Through this process, your symptoms improve as you build on your initial success. Medications Several types of medications are used to treat generalized anxiety disorder, including those below. Talk with your doctor about benefits, risks and possible side effects. - Antidepressants. Antidepressants, including medications in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) classes, are the first line medication treatments. Examples of antidepressants used to treat generalized anxiety disorder include escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor XR) and paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva). Your doctor also may recommend other antidepressants. - Buspirone. An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be used on an ongoing basis. As with most antidepressants, it typically takes up to several weeks to become fully effective. - Benzodiazepines. In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepine for relief of anxiety symptoms. These sedatives are generally used only for relieving acute anxiety on a short-term basis. Because they can be habit-forming, these medications aren't a good choice if you have or had problems with alcohol or drug abuse.",

Hormone therapy is an example of targeted therapy. It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth.        Cancer treatment can be local or systemic:     - Local treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.   - Systemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.     Most women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (recurring). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer. In most cases, stage IV breast cancer cannot be cured.     - Stage 0 and ductal carcinoma: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy is the standard treatment.   - Stage I and II: Lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with lymph node removal is the standard treatment. Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and other targeted therapy may also be used after surgery.   - Stage III: Treatment involves surgery, possibly followed by chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and other targeted therapy.   - Stage IV: Treatment may involve surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, other targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments.      After treatment, some women continue to take medicines for a time. All women continue to have blood tests, mammograms, and other tests after treatment to monitor for the return of cancer or development of another breast cancer.

Impaired function and symptoms depend on the type of nerves -- motor, sensory, or autonomic -- that are damaged.  Some people may experience temporary numbness, tingling, and pricking sensations, sensitivity to touch, or muscle weakness. Others may suffer more extreme symptoms, including burning pain (especially at night), muscle wasting, paralysis, or organ or gland dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy may be either inherited or acquired. Causes of acquired peripheral neuropathy include physical injury (trauma) to a nerve, tumors, toxins, autoimmune responses, nutritional deficiencies, alcoholism, medical procedures, and vascular and metabolic disorders. Acquired peripheral neuropathies are caused by systemic disease, trauma from external agents, or infections or autoimmune disorders affecting nerve tissue.

Disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are hereditary types of neuropathy.   - Trauma or pressure on the nerve. Traumas, such as from motor vehicle accidents, falls or sports injuries, can sever or damage peripheral nerves. Nerve pressure can result from having a cast or using crutches or repeating a motion such as typing many times.   - Tumors. Growths, cancerous (malignant) and noncancerous (benign), can develop on the nerves or press nerves. Also, polyneuropathy can arise as a result of some cancers related to the body's immune response.

People with SPS respond to high doses of diazepam and several anti-convulsants, gabapentin and tiagabine.  A recent study funded by the NINDS demonstrated the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) treatment in reducing stiffness and lowering sensitivity to noise, touch, and stress in people with SPS.  Treatment with IVIg, anti-anxiety drugs, muscle relaxants, anti-convulsants, and pain relievers will improve the symptoms of SPS, but will not cure the disorder.  Most individuals with SPS have frequent falls and because they lack the normal defensive reflexes; injuries can be severe.  With appropriate treatment, the symptoms are usually well controlled.",

            "knowledge": "congenital diaphragmatic hernia (Genetic Changes): Congenital diaphragmatic hernia has many different causes. In 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals, the condition appears as a feature of a disorder that affects many body systems, called a syndrome. Donnai-Barrow syndrome, Fryns syndrome, and Pallister-Killian mosaic syndrome are among several syndromes in which congenital diaphragmatic hernia may occur. Some of these syndromes are caused by changes in single genes, and others are caused by chromosomal abnormalities that affect several genes.   About 25 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia that is not associated with a known syndrome also have abnormalities of one or more major body systems. Affected body systems can include the heart, brain, skeleton, intestines, genitals, kidneys, or eyes. In these individuals, the multiple abnormalities likely result from a common underlying disruption in development that affects more than one area of the body, but the specific mechanism responsible for this disruption is not clear.   Approximately 50 to 60 percent of congenital diaphragmatic hernia cases are isolated, which means that affected individuals have no other major malformations.   More than 80 percent of individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia have no known genetic syndrome or chromosomal abnormality. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown. Researchers are studying changes in several genes involved in the development of the diaphragm as possible causes of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Some of these genes are transcription factors, which provide instructions for making proteins that help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression). Others provide instructions for making proteins involved in cell structure or the movement (migration) of cells in the embryo. Environmental factors that influence development before birth may also increase the risk of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, but these environmental factors have not been identified.",

If you've tried lifestyle changes and home remedies for diarrhea without success, your doctor might recommend medications or other treatments. Antibiotics Antibiotics might help treat diarrhea caused by bacteria or parasites. If a virus is causing your diarrhea, antibiotics won't help. Treatment to replace fluids Your doctor likely will advise you to replace the fluids and salts. For most adults, that means drinking water, juice or broth. If drinking liquids upsets your stomach or causes diarrhea, your doctor might recommend getting fluids through a vein in your arm (intravenously). Water is a good way to replace fluids, but it doesn't contain the salts and electrolytes - minerals such as sodium and potassium - you need to maintain the electric currents that keep your heart beating. You can help maintain your electrolyte levels by drinking fruit juices for potassium or eating soups for sodium. Certain fruit juices, such as apple juice, might make diarrhea worse. For children, ask your doctor about using an oral rehydration solution, such as Pedialyte, to prevent dehydration or replace lost fluids.

If you experience signs and symptoms, such as recurrent heartburn and acid reflux, you may need medication or surgery. Medications If you experience heartburn and acid reflux, your doctor may recommend: - Antacids that neutralize stomach acid. Antacids, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney problems. - Medications to reduce acid production. These medications - known as H-2-receptor blockers - include cimetidine (Tagamet famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid ) and ranitidine (Zantac). Stronger versions are available by prescription. - Medications that block acid production and heal the esophagus. These medications - known as proton pump inhibitors - are stronger acid blockers than H-2-receptor blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid 24HR) and omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid). Stronger versions are available in prescription form. Surgery Sometimes a hiatal hernia requires surgery. Surgery is generally used for people who aren't helped by medications to relieve heartburn and acid reflux, or have complications such as severe inflammation or narrowing of the esophagus. Surgery to repair a hiatal hernia may involve pulling your stomach down into your abdomen and making the opening in your diaphragm smaller, reconstructing an esophageal sphincter or removing the hernia sac. Or your surgeon may insert a tiny camera and special surgical tools through several small incisions in your abdomen. The operation is then performed while your surgeon views images from inside your body that are displayed on a video monitor (laparoscopic surgery). Sometimes surgery is done using a single incision in your chest wall (thoracotomy).",

            "knowledge": "Inguinal hernia (Treatment): If your hernia is small and isn't bothering you, your doctor might recommend watchful waiting. In children, the doctor might try applying manual pressure to reduce the bulge before considering surgery. Enlarging or painful hernias usually require surgery to relieve discomfort and prevent serious complications. There are two general types of hernia operations - open hernia repair and laparoscopic repair. Open hernia repair In this procedure, which might be done with local anesthesia and sedation or general anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision in your groin and pushes the protruding tissue back into your abdomen. The surgeon then sews the weakened area, often reinforcing it with a synthetic mesh (hernioplasty). The opening is then closed with stitches, staples or surgical glue. After the surgery, you'll be encouraged to move about as soon as possible, but it might be several weeks before you're able to resume normal activities. Laparoscopy In this minimally invasive procedure, which requires general anesthesia, the surgeon operates through several small incisions in your abdomen. Gas is used to inflate your abdomen to make the internal organs easier to see. A small tube equipped with a tiny camera (laparoscope) is inserted into one incision. Guided by the camera, the surgeon inserts tiny instruments through other incisions to repair the hernia using synthetic mesh. People who have laparoscopic repair might have less discomfort and scarring after surgery and a quicker return to normal activities. However, some studies indicate that hernia recurrence is more likely with laparoscopic repair than with open surgery. Laparoscopy allows the surgeon to avoid scar tissue from an earlier hernia repair, so it might be a good choice for people whose hernias recur after traditional hernia surgery. It also might be a good choice for people with hernias on both sides of the body (bilateral). Some studies indicate that a laparoscopic repair can increase the risk of complications and of recurrence. Having the procedure performed by a surgeon with extensive experience in laparoscopic hernia repairs can reduce the risks.",

            "knowledge": "Hiatal hernia: Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The diaphragm is the sheet of muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen. The exact cause of hiatal hernia is unknown. The condition may be due to weakness of the supporting tissue. Your risk for the problem goes up with age, obesity, and smoking. Hiatal hernias are very common. The problem occurs often in people over 50 years.   This condition may cause reflux (backflow) of gastric acid from the stomach into the esophagus.   Children with this condition are most often born with it (congenital). It often occurs with gastroesophageal reflux in infants. Symptoms may include:     - Chest pain   - Heartburn, worse when bending over or lying down   - Swallowing difficulty      A hiatal hernia by itself rarely causes symptoms. Pain and discomfort are due to the upward flow of stomach acid, air, or bile. Tests that may be used include:     - Barium swallow x-ray   - Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Treatments may include:     - Medicines to control stomach acid   - Surgery to repair the hiatal hernia and prevent reflux     Other measures to reduce symptoms include:     - Avoiding large or heavy meals   - Not lying down or bending over right after a meal   - Reducing weight and not smoking   - Raising the head of the bed 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters)     If medicines and lifestyle measures do not help control symptoms, you may need surgery. Treatment can relieve most symptoms of hiatal hernia. Complications may include:     - Pulmonary (lung) aspiration   - Slow bleeding and iron deficiency anemia (due to a large hernia)   - Strangulation (closing off) of the hernia Call your health care provider if:     - You have symptoms of a hiatal hernia.   - You have a hiatal hernia and your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment.   - You develop new symptoms.

Your health care provider will talk about things you can do at home to manage your condition. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be a lifelong condition. You may be suffering from cramping and loose stools, diarrhea, constipation, or some combination of these symptoms.   For some people, IBS symptoms may interfere with work, travel, and attending social events. But taking medicines and making lifestyle changes can help you manage your symptoms. Changes in your diet may be helpful. However, IBS varies from person to person. So the same changes may not work for everyone.     - Keep track of your symptoms and the foods you are eating. This will help you look for a pattern of foods that may make your symptoms worse.   - Avoid foods that cause symptoms. These may include fatty or fried foods, dairy products, caffeine, sodas, alcohol, chocolate, and grains such as wheat, rye, and barley.   - Eat 4 to 5 smaller meals a day, rather than 3 larger ones.      Increase the fiber in your diet to relieve symptoms of constipation. Fiber is found in whole grain breads and cereals, beans, fruits, and vegetables. Since fiber may cause gas, it is best to add these foods to your diet slowly. No one drug will work for everyone. Medicines your provider may have you try include:     - Antispasmodic medicines that you take before eating to control colon muscle spasms and abdominal cramping   - Antidiarrheal medicines such as loperamide   - Laxatives, such as lubiprostone, bisacodyl , and other ones bought without a prescription   - Antidepressants to help relieve pain or discomfort   - Rifaximin, an antibiotic that is not absorbed from your intestines      It is very important to follow your provider's instructions when using medicines for IBS. Taking different medicines or not taking medicines the way you have been advised can lead to more problems. Stress may cause your intestines to be more sensitive and contract more. Many things can cause stress, including:      - Not being able to do activities because of your pain   - Changes or problems at work or at home   - A busy schedule   - Spending too much time alone   - Having other medical problems      A first step toward reducing your stress is to figure out what makes you feel stressed.     - Look at the things in your life that cause you the most worry.   - Keep a diary of the experiences and thoughts that seem to be related to your anxiety and see if you can make changes to these situations.   - Reach out to other people.   - Find someone you trust (such as a friend, family member, neighbor, or clergy member) who will listen to you. Often, just talking to someone helps relieve anxiety and stress. Call your provider if:     - You develop a fever   - You have gastrointestinal bleeding   - You have bad pain that does not go away   - You lose over 5 to 10 pounds (2 to 4.5 kilograms) when you are not trying to lose weight Updated by: Michael M.

            "knowledge": "Frozen shoulder - aftercare: A frozen shoulder is shoulder pain that leads to stiffness of your shoulder. Often the pain and stiffness are present all the time. The capsule of the shoulder joint is made of strong tissue (ligaments) that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones cannot move freely in the joint. This condition is called frozen shoulder.   Frozen shoulder may develop with no known cause. It can also occur in people who:      - Have thyroid disease, diabetes, or are going through menopause   - Have a shoulder injury   - Have had a stroke that makes them unable to use their arm   - Have a cast on their arm that holds their arm in one position Symptoms of frozen shoulder often follow this pattern:      - At first, you have a lot of pain, or a freezing feeling that prevents you from moving your arm.   - Then your shoulder becomes very stiff and hard to move, but the pain lessens. It becomes hard to reach over your head or behind you.   - Finally, the pain goes away and you can use your arm again. This is the thawing phase and can take months to end.      It can take a few months to go through these stages of frozen shoulder. The shoulder can get very painful and stiff before it starts to loosen. It can take as long as 18 to 24 months for complete healing. To help speed healing, your health care provider will likely do the following:      - Teach you exercises to restore motion in your shoulder joint.   - Refer you to a physical therapist.   - Prescribe medicines for you to take by mouth. These include drugs to reduce pain and inflammation in the shoulder joint. You may also receive a shot of anti-inflammatory drug directly into the joint.      Most people have a full recovery with full range of motion without surgery. Using moist heat on your shoulder 3 to 4 times a day may help relieve some pain and stiffness.   For pain, you can use ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or acetaminophen (Tylenol). You can buy these pain medicines at the store.     - Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past.   - DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider. Get help setting up your home so that you can get to everything you need without reaching above your shoulders or behind your back.      - Keep the clothes that you wear most often in drawers and shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.   - Store food in cupboards, drawers, and refrigerator shelves that are between your waist and shoulder level.      Get help with house cleaning, taking out the garbage, gardening, and other household tasks.   DO NOT lift heavy things or do activities that require a lot of shoulder and arm strength. You will learn some simple exercises and stretches for your shoulder.     - At first, try to do these exercises once every hour, or at least 4 times a day.   - It is more important to do the exercises often than to do them for a long time each time you do them.   - Use moist heat before the exercises to help lessen pain and increase movement.   - The exercises should focus on stretching of the shoulder and range of motion.   - Avoid exercises to strengthen your shoulder until the range of motion has returned.      Some of the exercises are:      - Shoulder stretches   - Pendulum   - Wall crawl   - Rope and pulley stretches   - Movements to help with internal and external rotation, such as hand behind back      Your provider or physical therapist will show you how to do these exercises.

The capsule of the shoulder joint has ligaments that hold the shoulder bones to each other. When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint.   Most of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Risk factors include:     - Diabetes   - Thyroid problems   - Changes in your hormones, such as during menopause   - Shoulder injury   - Shoulder surgery   - Open heart surgery   - Cervical disk disease of the neck    - Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected Main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are:     - Decreased motion of the shoulder   - Pain   - Stiffness      Frozen shoulder without any known cause starts with pain. This pain prevents you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you. Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made when you are not able to rotate your shoulder.   You may have x-rays of the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an MRI exam shows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. Pain is treated with NSAIDs and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion.   It can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 6 to 9 months for complete recovery. Physical therapy is intense and needs to be done every day.   Left untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little loss of motion.   Risk factors for frozen shoulder, such as diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated.   Surgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (shoulder arthroscopy) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is released (cut) by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove the scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy.   Follow instructions on caring for your shoulder at home.  Treatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years.   After surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months. This is to prevent the frozen shoulder from returning. If you do not keep up with physical therapy, the frozen shoulder may come back. Complications may include:     - Stiffness and pain continue even with therapy   - The arm can break if the shoulder is moved forcefully during surgery If you have shoulder pain and stiffness and think you have a frozen shoulder, contact your provider for referral and treatment. Early treatment may help prevent stiffness. Call your provider if you develop shoulder pain that limits your range of motion for an extended period.    People who have diabetes or thyroid problems will be less likely to get frozen shoulder if they keep their condition under control. Updated by: C.

In some cases, your doctor may prescribe stronger pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory drugs.

Your commitment to doing these exercises is important to optimize recovery of your mobility. Surgical and other procedures Most frozen shoulders get better on their own within 12 to 18 months. For persistent symptoms, your doctor may suggest: - Steroid injections. Injecting corticosteroids into your shoulder joint may help decrease pain and improve shoulder mobility, especially in the early stages of the process. - Joint distension. Injecting sterile water into the joint capsule can help stretch the tissue and make it easier to move the joint. - Shoulder manipulation. In this procedure, you receive a general anesthetic, so you'll be unconscious and feel no pain. Then the doctor moves your shoulder joint in different directions, to help loosen the tightened tissue. - Surgery. Surgery for frozen shoulder is rare, but if nothing else has helped, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove scar tissue and adhesions from inside your shoulder joint. Doctors usually perform this surgery with lighted, tubular instruments inserted through small incisions around your joint (arthroscopically).",

However, cannabis - commonly known as marijuana - is thought to ease nausea and other digestive complaints. Derivatives of cannabis have been used by people who have cancer in the past, but there are better FDA-approved medications available to control nausea now.

Gastroparesis can occur when the vagus nerve is damaged by illness or injury and the stomach muscles stop working normally. Food then moves slowly from the stomach to the small intestine or stops moving altogether. Most people diagnosed with gastroparesis have idiopathic gastroparesis, which means a health care provider cannot identify the cause, even with medical tests. Diabetes is the most common known cause of gastroparesis. People with diabetes have high levels of blood glucose, also called blood sugar. Over time, high blood glucose levels can damage the vagus nerve. The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are nausea, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount of food, and vomiting undigested food— sometimes several hours after a meal. Other common symptoms include gastroesophageal reflux (GER), pain in the stomach area, abdominal bloating, and lack of appetite. Gastroparesis is diagnosed through a physical exam, medical history, blood tests, tests to rule out blockage or structural problems in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and gastric emptying tests. Changing eating habits can sometimes help control the severity of gastroparesis symptoms. A health care provider may suggest eating six small meals a day instead of three large ones. When a person has severe symptoms, a liquid or puréed diet may be prescribed. Treatment of gastroparesis may include medications, botulinum toxin, gastric electrical stimulation, jejunostomy, and parenteral nutrition.

Most people can be treated with eye drops.   - Most of the eye drops used today have fewer side effects than those used in the past.   - You also may be given pills to lower pressure in the eye.      If drops alone do not work, you may need other treatment:     - Laser treatment uses a painless laser to open the channels where fluid flows out.   - If drops and laser treatment do not work, you may need surgery. The doctor will open a new channel so fluid can escape. This will help lower your pressure.   - Recently, new implants have been developed that can help treat glaucoma in people having cataract surgery.     ACUTE ANGLE GLAUCOMA   An acute angle-closure attack is a medical emergency. You can become blind in a few days if you are not treated.      - You may be given drops, pills, and medicine given through a vein (by IV) to lower your eye pressure.   - Some people also need an emergency operation, called an iridotomy. The doctor uses a laser to open a new channel in the iris. Sometimes this is done with surgery. The new channel relieves the attack and will prevent another attack.   - To help prevent an attack in the other eye, the procedure will often be performed on the other eye. This may be done even if it has never had an attack.      CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA     - Congenital glaucoma is almost always treated with surgery.   - This is done using general anesthesia.

There are four major types of glaucoma:     - Open-angle glaucoma   - Angle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma   - Congenital glaucoma   - Secondary glaucoma      The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and angle.   Anything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye.      - In open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow.   - In closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden.   - Either type can damage the optic nerve.      Open-angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma.     - The cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it.   - The increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision.   - Open-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease.      Closed-angle glaucoma occurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye. This causes a quick, severe rise in eye pressure.     - Dilating eye drops and certain medicines may trigger an acute glaucoma attack.   - Closed-angle glaucoma is an emergency.   - If you have had acute glaucoma in one eye, you are at risk for it in the second eye. Your health care provider is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye.      Secondary glaucoma occurs due to a known cause. Both open- and closed-angle glaucoma can be secondary when caused by something known. Causes include:     - Drugs such as corticosteroids   - Eye diseases such as uveitis (an infection of the middle layer of the eye)   - Diseases such as diabetes   - Eye injury      Congenital glaucoma occurs in babies.      - It often runs in families.   - It is present at birth.   - It is caused when the eye does not develop normally.",

Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits. Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). - Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits. Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets. Surgery In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left. During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results. Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring. Wigs and hairpieces You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available. If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor.",

            "knowledge": "Scoliosis (Treatment): Most children with scoliosis have mild curves and probably won't need treatment with a brace or surgery. Children who have mild scoliosis may need checkups every four to six months to see if there have been changes in the curvature of their spines. While there are guidelines for mild, moderate and severe curves, the decision to begin treatment is always made on an individual basis. Factors to be considered include: - Sex. Girls have a much higher risk of progression than do boys. - Severity of curve. Larger curves are more likely to worsen with time. - Curve pattern. Double curves, also known as S-shaped curves, tend to worsen more often than do C-shaped curves. - Location of curve. Curves located in the center (thoracic) section of the spine worsen more often than do curves in the upper or lower sections of the spine. - Maturity. If a child's bones have stopped growing, the risk of curve progression is low. That also means that braces have the most effect in children whose bones are still growing. Braces If your child's bones are still growing and he or she has moderate scoliosis, your doctor may recommend a brace. Wearing a brace won't cure scoliosis or reverse the curve, but it usually prevents further progression of the curve. The most common type of brace is made of plastic and is contoured to conform to the body. This close-fitting brace is almost invisible under the clothes, as it fits under the arms and around the rib cage, lower back and hips. Most braces are worn day and night. A brace's effectiveness increases with the number of hours a day it's worn. Children who wear braces can usually participate in most activities and have few restrictions. If necessary, kids can take off the brace to participate in sports or other physical activities. Braces are discontinued after the bones stop growing. This typically occurs: - About two years after girls begin to menstruate - When boys need to shave daily - When there are no further changes in height Surgery Severe scoliosis typically progresses with time, so your doctor might suggest scoliosis surgery to reduce the severity of the spinal curve and to prevent it from getting worse. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is called spinal fusion. In spinal fusion, surgeons connect two or more of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) together, so they can't move independently. Pieces of bone or a bone-like material are placed between the vertebrae. Metal rods, hooks, screws or wires typically hold that part of the spine straight and still while the old and new bone material fuses together. If the scoliosis is progressing rapidly at a young age, surgeons can install a rod that can adjust in length as the child grows. This growing rod is attached to the top and bottom sections of the spinal curvature, and is usually lengthened every six months. Complications of spinal surgery may include bleeding, infection, pain or nerve damage. Rarely, the bone fails to heal and another surgery may be needed.",

You may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly.   Surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible:     - Surgery is done with a cut through the back, belly area, or beneath the ribs.   - The spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods. The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together.   - After surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still.

            "knowledge": "Obesity (Treatment): CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE    An active lifestyle and plenty of exercise, along with healthy eating, is the safest way to lose weight. Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.   Your main goal should be to learn new, healthy ways of eating and make them part of your daily routine.   Many people find it hard to change their eating habits and behaviors. You may have practiced some habits for so long that you may not even know they are unhealthy, or you do them without thinking. You need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes. Make the behavior change part of your life over the long term. Know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle.   Work with your provider and dietitian to set realistic, safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy. Remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily, you are more likely to keep them off. Your dietitian can teach you about:     - Healthy food choices   - Healthy snacks   - Reading nutrition labels   - New ways to prepare food   - Portion sizes   - Sweetened drinks      Extreme diets (fewer than 1100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well. These types of diets often DO NOT contain enough vitamins and minerals. Most people who lose weight this way return to overeating and become obese again.   Learn ways to manage stress other than snacking. Examples may be meditation, yoga, or exercise. If you are depressed or stressed a lot, talk to your provider.    MEDICINES AND HERBAL REMEDIES    You may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight. Some of these claims may not be true. And some of these supplements can have serious side effects. Talk to your provider before using them.   You can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor. Many people lose at least 5 pounds (2 kg) by taking these drugs, but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes.   SURGERY    Bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain diseases in people with severe obesity. These risks include:     - Arthritis   - Diabetes   - Heart disease   - High blood pressure   - Sleep apnea   - Some cancers   - Stroke      Surgery may help people who have been very obese for 5 years or more and have not lost weight from other treatments, such as diet, exercise, or medicine.   Surgery alone is not the answer for weight loss. It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work. You must be committed to diet and exercise after surgery. Talk to your doctor to learn if surgery is a good option for you.   Weight-loss surgeries include:     - Laparoscopic gastric banding   - Gastric bypass surgery   - Sleeve gastrectomy (less common)   - Duodenal switch",

Among women with fertility problems, endometriosis may occur in as many as 50%.1 But exactly how endometriosis causes infertility is not clear. Some evidence suggests that infertility is related to the extent of the endometriosis patches, because the patches can distort the pelvic anatomy. This would make it difficult for sperm to travel to the ovary or a fertilized egg to travel to the uterus.2,3 Other evidence suggests that the inflammation in the abdomen may disrupt ovulation or fertilization, or that the endometrium may not develop properly, hampering the attachment of the embryo to the uterus. There are treatments for endometriosis-related infertility that may help women get pregnant even with endometriosis. - Is endometriosis the same as endometrial cancer? Endometriosis and endometrial cancer are not the same. The word \"endometrium\" describes the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus. Endometrial cancer is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the inside of the uterus. Endometriosis itself is not a form of cancer. - Can endometriosis lead to cancer? There is a slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer among women with endometriosis, particularly among women who were diagnosed with the condition at an early age. However, it is unclear whether endometriosis causes ovarian cancer or if the two conditions share risk factors or disease mechanisms that make them more likely to occur together.3,4 In some cases, women with endometriosis also have breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, these situations are rare.5 - Does endometriosis ever go away? For about one-quarter of women diagnosed with endometriosis, endometriosis patches go away on their own.6 Also, after menopause, symptoms of endometriosis typically lessen because there is a drop in the woman's natural hormones and the growths gradually shrink. However, this is not true for all women. If a woman takes hormones for menopausal symptoms, both her pain symptoms and the growths may return. Women with endometriosis who are experiencing symptoms, especially after menopause, should talk with their health care providers about treatment options.",

Although many women experience cramping during their menstrual period, women with endometriosis typically describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. They also tend to report that the pain increases over time. Common signs and symptoms of endometriosis may include: - Painful periods (dysmenorrhea). Pelvic pain and cramping may begin before your period and extend several days into your period. You may also have lower back and abdominal pain.   - Pain with intercourse. Pain during or after sex is common with endometriosis.   - Pain with bowel movements or urination. You're most likely to experience these symptoms during your period.   - Excessive bleeding. You may experience occasional heavy periods (menorrhagia) or bleeding between periods (menometrorrhagia).   - Infertility. Endometriosis is first diagnosed in some women who are seeking treatment for infertility.   - Other symptoms. You may also experience fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea, especially during menstrual periods. The severity of your pain isn't necessarily a reliable indicator of the extent of the condition. Some women with mild endometriosis have intense pain, while others with advanced endometriosis may have little pain or even no pain at all. Endometriosis is sometimes mistaken for other conditions that can cause pelvic pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or ovarian cysts. It may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition that causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and abdominal cramping. IBS can accompany endometriosis, which can complicate the diagnosis. See your doctor if you have signs and symptoms that may indicate endometriosis. Endometriosis can be a challenging condition to manage. An early diagnosis, a multidisciplinary medical team and an understanding of your diagnosis may result in better management of your symptoms.",

            "knowledge": "Endometriosis (What are the symptoms of endometriosis?): The primary symptoms of endometriosis are pain and infertility.- Among women with pelvic pain, endometriosis may occur in about 75%.1,2 - Among women with fertility problems, endometriosis may occur in as many as 50%.1Other common symptoms of endometriosis include:- Painful, even debilitating, menstrual cramps, which may get worse over time - Pain during or after sex - Pain in the intestine or lower abdomen - Painful bowel movements or painful urination during menstrual periods - Heavy menstrual periods - Premenstrual spotting or bleeding between periodsIn addition, women who are diagnosed with endometriosis may have painful bladder syndrome, digestive or gastrointestinal symptoms similar to a bowel disorder, as well as fatigue, tiredness, or lack of energy.2For some women, the pain symptoms associated with endometriosis get milder after menopause, but this is not always the case. Hormone therapy such as estrogen or birth control pills, given to reduce menopausal symptoms, may cause these endometriosis symptoms to continue.Researchers know that pain is a primary symptom of endometriosis, but it is not known how pain arises in women with endometriosis.The severity of pain does not correspond with the number, location, or extent of endometriosis lesions. Some women with only a few small lesions experience severe pain; other women may have very large patches of endometriosis, but only experience little pain.3,4Current evidence suggests several possible explanations for pain associated with endometriosis, including (but not limited to):3,4- Patches of endometriosis respond to hormones in a similar way as the lining of the uterus. These tissues may bleed or have evidence of inflammation every month, similar to a regular menstrual period. However, the blood and tissue shed from endometriosis patches stay in the body and are irritants, which can cause pain. - In some cases, inflammation and chemicals produced by the endometriosis areas can cause the pelvic organs to adhere, or stick together, causing scar tissue. This makes the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as the bladder and rectum, appear as one large organ. - Hormones and chemicals released by endometriosis tissue also may irritate nearby tissue and cause the release of other chemicals known to cause pain. - Over time, some endometriosis areas may form nodules or bumps as they create lesions on the surface of pelvic organs or can become cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries. - Some endometriosis lesions have nerves in them, tying the patches directly into the central nervous system. These nerves may be more sensitive to pain-causing chemicals released in the lesions and surrounding areas. Over time, they may be more easily activated by the chemicals than normal nerve cells are. - Patches of endometriosis might also press against nearby nerve cells to cause pain. - Some women report less endometriosis pain after pregnancy, but the reason for this is unclear. Researchers are trying to determine if the reduction results from the hormones released by the body during pregnancy, or from changes in the cervix, uterus, or endometrium that occur during pregnancy and delivery.Pain from endometriosis can be severe, interfering with day-to-day activities. Understanding how endometriosis is related to pain is a very active area of research because it could allow for more effective treatments for this specific type of pain.",

            "knowledge": "Knock knees: Knock knees are condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. The legs turn inward. Infants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart.   By puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position).   Knock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as:     - Injury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed)   - Osteomyelitis (bone infection)   - Overweight or obesity   - Rickets (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D) A health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development. Knock knees are not treated in most cases.   If the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace. This brace is attached to a shoe.    Surgery may be considered for knock knees that are severe and continue beyond late childhood. Children normally outgrow knock knees without treatment, unless it is caused by a disease.    If surgery is needed, the results are most often good. Complications may include:     - Difficulty walking (very rare)   - Self-esteem changes related to cosmetic appearance of knock knees   - If left untreated, knock knees can lead to early arthritis of the knee Call your provider if you think your child has knock knees. There is no known prevention for normal knock knees. Updated by: Neil K. Kaneshiro, MD, MHA, Clinical Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.

            "knowledge": "Rhinoplasty: Rhinoplasty is surgery to repair or reshape the nose. Rhinoplasty can be performed under local or general anesthesia, depending on the exact procedure and the person's preference. It is performed in a surgeon's office, a hospital, or an outpatient surgery center. Complex procedures may require a short hospital stay. The procedure often takes 1 to 2 hours. It may take longer.   With local anesthesia, the nose and the area around it are numbed. You will probably be lightly sedated, but awake during the surgery (relaxed and not feeling pain). General anesthesia allows you to sleep through the operation.   The surgery is usually done through a cut (incision) made inside the nostrils. In some cases, the cut is made from outside, around the base of the nose. This type of cut is used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a cartilage graft. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend around the nostrils. Small incisions may be made on the side of the nose to break, and reshape the bone.   A splint (metal or plastic) may be placed on the outside of the nose. This helps maintain the new shape of the bone when the surgery is finished. Soft plastic splints or nasal packs also may be placed in the nostrils. This helps keep the dividing wall between the air passages (septum) stable. Rhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures. It can be used to:     - Reduce or increase the size of the nose   - Change the shape of the tip or the nasal bridge   - Narrow the opening of the nostrils   - Change the angle between the nose and the upper lip   - Correct a birth defect or injury   - Help relieve some breathing problems      Nose surgery is considered elective when it is done for cosmetic reasons. In these cases, the purpose is to change the shape of the nose to one that the person finds more desirable. Many surgeons prefer to perform cosmetic nose surgery after the nasal bone has finished growing. This is around age 14 or 15 for girls and a bit later for boys. Risks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:     - Reactions to medicines, problems breathing   - Bleeding, infection, or bruising      Risks for this procedure include:     - Loss of support of the nose   - Contour deformities of the nose   - Need for further surgery     After surgery, tiny blood vessels that have burst may appear as tiny red spots on the skin surface. These are usually minor, but are permanent. There are no visible scars if the rhinoplasty is performed from inside the nose. If the procedure narrows flared nostrils, there may be small scars at the base of the nose that are not often visible.   In rare cases, a second procedure is needed to fix a minor deformity. Your surgeon may give you instructions to follow before your surgery. You may need to:     - Stop any medicines that thin your blood. Your surgeon will give you a list of these medicines.   - See your regular health care provider to have some routine tests and make sure it is safe for you to have surgery.   - To aid with healing, stop smoking 2 to 3 weeks before and after surgery.   - Arrange to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually go home on the same day as your surgery.   Right after surgery, your nose and face will be swollen and painful. Headaches are common.   The nasal packing is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel more comfortable.   The splint may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks. Full recovery takes several weeks.   Healing is a slow and gradual process. The tip of the nose may have some swelling and numbness for months. You may not be able to see the final results for up to a year. Updated by: David A.

            "knowledge": "Nose fracture: A nose fracture is a break in the bone or cartilage over the bridge, or in the sidewall or septum (structure that divides the nostrils) of the nose. A fractured nose is the most common fracture of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face.   Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck.   Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an abscess or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse.   For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape.   Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury. Symptoms may include:     - Blood coming from the nose   - Bruising around the eyes   - Difficulty breathing through the nose   - Misshapen appearance (may not be obvious until the swelling goes down)   - Pain   - Swelling     The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks. If a nose injury happens:     - Try to stay calm.   - Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat.   - Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding.   - Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose.   - To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). - DO NOT try to straighten a broken nose   - DO NOT move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or neck injury Get medical help right away if:     - Bleeding will not stop   - Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose   - You suspect a blood clot in the septum   - You suspect a neck or head injury   - The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape   - The person is having difficulty breathing Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, or riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades.   Use seat belts and appropriate car seats when driving. Updated by: Josef Shargorodsky, MD, MPH, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.

            "knowledge": "Anal fissure (Treatment): Anal fissures often heal within a few weeks if you take steps to keep your stool soft, such as increasing your intake of fiber and fluids. Soaking in warm water for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day, especially after bowel movements, can help relax the sphincter and promote healing. If your symptoms persist, you'll likely need further treatment. Nonsurgical treatments Your doctor may recommend: - Externally applied nitroglycerin (Rectiv), to help increase blood flow to the fissure and promote healing and to help relax the anal sphincter. Nitroglycerin is generally considered the medical treatment of choice when other conservative measures fail. Side effects may include headache, which can be severe. - Topical anesthetic creams such as lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may be helpful for pain relief. - Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, to paralyze the anal sphincter muscle and relax spasms. - Blood pressure medications, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter. These medications may be taken by mouth or applied externally and may be used when nitroglycerin is not effective or causes significant side effects. Surgery If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery. Doctors usually perform a procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS), which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing.

The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine; however, in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia).   Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life.   Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly).

            "knowledge": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (Genetic Changes): Both the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis are caused by mutations in the SLC4A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making the anion exchanger 1 (AE1) protein, which transports negatively charged atoms (anions) across cell membranes. Specifically, AE1 exchanges negatively charged atoms of chlorine (chloride ions) for negatively charged bicarbonate molecules (bicarbonate ions). The AE1 protein is found in the cell membrane of kidney cells and red blood cells. In kidney cells, the exchange of bicarbonate through AE1 allows acid to be released from the cell into the urine. In red blood cells, AE1 attaches to other proteins that make up the structural framework (the cytoskeleton) of the cells, helping to maintain their structure.   The SLC4A1 gene mutations involved in either form of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis lead to production of altered AE1 proteins that cannot get to the correct location in the cell membrane. In the autosomal dominant form of the condition, gene mutations affect only one copy of the SLC4A1 gene, and normal AE1 protein is produced from the other copy. However, the altered protein attaches to the normal protein and keeps it from getting to the correct location, leading to a severe reduction or absence of AE1 protein in the cell membrane. In autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis, both copies of the SLC4A1 gene are mutated, so all of the protein produced from this gene is altered and not able to get to the correct location. Improper location or absence of AE1 in kidney cell membranes disrupts bicarbonate exchange, and as a result, acid cannot be released into the urine. Instead, the acid builds up in the blood in most affected individuals, leading to metabolic acidosis and the other features of complete distal renal tubular acidosis. It is not clear why some people develop metabolic acidosis and others do not. Researchers suggest that in individuals with incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, another mechanism is able to help regulate blood acidity (pH) and keep metabolic acidosis from developing.   In red blood cells, interaction with a protein called glycophorin A can often help the altered AE1 protein get to the cell membrane where it can perform its function, which explains why most people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis do not have blood cell abnormalities. However, some altered AE1 proteins cannot be helped by glycophorin A and are not found in the cell membrane. Without AE1, the red blood cells are unstable; breakdown of these abnormal red blood cells may lead to hemolytic anemia.   Some people have nonhereditary forms of distal renal tubular acidosis; these forms can be caused by immune system problems or other conditions that damage the kidneys. These individuals often have additional signs and symptoms related to the original condition.",

People affected by this condition may experience a variety of symptoms such as changes in alertness and attention; hallucinations; problems with movement and posture; muscle stiffness; confusion; and/or memory loss. Although the exact cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood, symptoms are thought to result when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein (\"Lewy bodies\") accumulate in the brain. Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. Rarely, more than one family member may be affected. There is currently no cure for Lewy body dementia; however, medications may be available to help manage the associated symptoms. [1] [2] [3] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Autosomal dominant inheritance - Delusions - Dementia - Fluctuations in consciousness - Parkinsonism - Visual hallucinations - The exact underlying cause of Lewy body dementia is poorly understood. The symptoms of the condition are thought to occur when clumps of a protein called alpha-synuclein accumulate in the regions of the brain involved in thinking, memory and movement. The build-up of these clumps (which are called \"Lewy bodies\") appears to be associated with a loss of certain neurons (nerve cells ) in the brain that produce two important neurotransmitters (chemicals that act as messengers between brain cells). The neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, is important for memory and learning. The other, dopamine, plays an important role in behavior, cognition, movement, motivation, sleep, and mood. [4] Although Lewy body dementia usually occurs sporadically, more than one family member can rarely be affected. Studies of these families suggest that there may be a genetic component to the condition in some cases. For example, copy number variants or changes ( mutations ) in the SNCA gene have been reported in a few affected families. [5] [6] The APOE ε4 allele and mutations in the GBA gene have been associated with an increased risk of Lewy body dementia and the APOE ε2 allele with a decreased risk. [5] [7] [2] Most cases of Lewy body dementia are not thought to be inherited . The condition generally occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. [4] Rarely, the condition can affect more than one family member. Some of these cases appear to be due to single gene changes ( mutations ) that follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Other familial cases do not follow a specific pattern of inheritance and likely have a multifactorial cause (associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ). [6] [5] Making a diagnosis for a genetic or rare disease can often be challenging. Healthcare professionals typically look at a person’s medical history, symptoms, physical exam, and laboratory test results in order to make a diagnosis. The following resources provide information relating to diagnosis and testing for this condition. If you have questions about getting a diagnosis, you should contact a healthcare professional.

Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.  A much rarer form of the disorder, called late-onset Tay-Sachs disease, occurs in individuals in their twenties and early thirties and is characterized by an unsteady gait and progressive neurological deterioration. The incidence of Tay-Sachs has been particularly high among people of Eastern European and Askhenazi Jewish descent., as well as in certain French Canadians and Louisiana Cajuns. Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test that measures hexosaminidase A activity. Both parents must carry the mutated gene in order to have an affected child. In these instances, there is a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy that the child will be affected with Tay-Sachs disease. Prenatal diagnosis is available if desired.  A very severe form of Tay-Sachs disease is know as Sandhoff disease, which is not limited to any ethnic group. Presently there is no specific treatment for Tay-Sachs disease. Anticonvulsant medicine may initially control seizures. Other supportive treatment includes proper nutrition and hydration and techniques to keep the airway open. Children may eventually need a feeding tube.

            "knowledge": "Menkes syndrome: In Menkes syndrome, cells in the body can absorb copper, but they are unable to release it. It is one of several conditions called an \"inborn error of metabolism.\" Menkes syndrome is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to distribute copper in food from the intestines into the bloodstream for use in other areas. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper.   Copper can build up in the small intestine and kidneys, but low copper levels in other areas can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function.    Menkes syndrome is inherited, which means it runs in families. The gene is on the X-chromosome, so if a mother carries the defective gene, each of her sons has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of developing the disease, and 50% of her daughters will be a carrier of the disease. Symptoms of Menkes syndrome are:     - Bone spurs   - Brittle, kinky hair   - Feeding difficulties   - Irritability   - Lack of muscle tone, floppiness   - Low body temperature   - Mental deterioration   - Pudgy, rosy cheeks   - Seizures   - Skeletal changes There is often a history of Menkes syndrome in a male relative.   Signs include:     - Abnormal appearance of the hair under a microscope   - Abnormally low body temperature   - Bleeding in the brain   - Slow growth in the womb      In males, all of the hairs will be abnormal. In females who carry this trait, half of them may have areas of abnormal hair.   Tests may include:     - Serum ceruloplasmin (substance that transports copper in the blood)   - Serum copper level   - Skin cell culture   - X-ray of the skeleton or x-ray of the skull     Genetic testing may show a change (mutation) in the ATP7A gene. Treatment usually only helps when started very early in the course of the disease. Injections of copper into a vein or under the skin have been used with mixed results. Most people with this condition die within the first few years of life. - Seizures   - Death Talk to your health care provider if you have a family history of Menkes syndrome and you plan to have children. A baby with this condition will often show symptoms early in infancy. See a genetic counselor if you want to have children and you have a family history of Menkes syndrome. Maternal relatives (relatives on the mother's side of the family) of a boy with this syndrome should be seen by a geneticist to find out if they are carriers.

            "knowledge": "ATP7A gene (Menkes syndrome): Researchers have identified more than 150 mutations in the ATP7A gene that cause Menkes syndrome. Many of these mutations delete part of the gene and likely result in a shortened ATP7A protein. Other mutations insert additional DNA building blocks (nucleotides) into the gene or change single nucleotides. All of these mutations prevent the production of functional ATP7A protein. As a result, the absorption of copper from food is impaired, and copper is not supplied to certain enzymes. The abnormal protein may get stuck in the cell membrane and become unable to shuttle back and forth from the Golgi apparatus.   The disrupted activity of the ATP7A protein causes copper to be poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of Menkes syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes.",

            "knowledge": "Milroy disease: Milroy disease is a condition that affects the normal function of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system produces and transports fluids and immune cells throughout the body. Impaired transport with accumulation of lymph fluid can cause swelling (lymphedema). Individuals with Milroy disease typically have lymphedema in their lower legs and feet at birth or develop it in infancy. The lymphedema typically occurs on both sides of the body and may worsen over time.   Milroy disease is associated with other features in addition to lymphedema. Males with Milroy disease are sometimes born with an accumulation of fluid in the scrotum (hydrocele). Males and females may have upslanting toenails, deep creases in the toes, wart-like growths (papillomas), and prominent leg veins. Some individuals develop non-contagious skin infections called cellulitis that can damage the thin tubes that carry lymph fluid (lymphatic vessels). Episodes of cellulitis can cause further swelling in the lower limbs. Milroy disease is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Mutations in the FLT4 gene cause some cases of Milroy disease. The FLT4 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3), which regulates the development and maintenance of the lymphatic system. Mutations in the FLT4 gene interfere with the growth, movement, and survival of cells that line the lymphatic vessels (lymphatic endothelial cells). These mutations lead to the development of small or absent lymphatic vessels. If lymph fluid is not properly transported, it builds up in the body's tissues and causes lymphedema. It is not known how mutations in the FLT4 gene lead to the other features of this disorder.   Many individuals with Milroy disease do not have a mutation in the FLT4 gene. In these individuals, the cause of the disorder is unknown. Milroy disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In many cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases may result from new mutations in the FLT4 gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. About 10 percent to 15 percent of people with a mutation in the FLT4 gene do not develop the features of Milroy disease.

            "knowledge": "EVC gene: The EVC gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. However, it appears to be important for normal growth and development, particularly the development of bones and teeth. The EVC protein is found in primary cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. In particular, the EVC protein is thought to help regulate a signaling pathway known as Sonic Hedgehog, which plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body.   EVC and another gene, EVC2, are located very close together on chromosome 4. Researchers believe that the two genes may have related functions and that their activity may be coordinated. More than 25 mutations in the EVC gene have been reported to cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by dwarfism, abnormal nails and teeth, and heart defects. The mutations that cause this condition occur in both copies of the EVC gene in each cell. These genetic changes disrupt the normal function of the EVC protein or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein. Although it is unclear how the loss of this protein's function underlies the signs and symptoms of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, researchers believe that it may prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo. Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition.

At least one mutation in the EVC gene has been found to cause the characteristic features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis, affecting the development of the teeth, nails, and bones. The signs and symptoms of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis are similar to, but typically milder than, those of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome.   The EVC gene mutation that causes Weyers acrofacial dysostosis occurs in one copy of the gene in each cell. It changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the EVC protein, replacing the amino acid serine with the amino acid proline at position 307 (written as Ser307Pro). It is unclear how this genetic change leads to the specific features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Studies suggest that the abnormal protein interferes with Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo, disrupting the normal formation and growth of the teeth, nails, and bones.

People with this condition typically experience night blindness and other vision problems, including loss of sharpness ( reduced visual acuity), severe nearsightedness (myopia), nystagmus , and strabismus . Color vision is typically not affected. These vision problems are usually evident at birth, but tend to be stable (stationary) over time. There are two major types of XLCSNB: the complete form and the incomplete form. Both types have very similar signs and symptoms. However, everyone with the complete form has night blindness, while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness. The types are distinguished by their genetic cause. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

            "knowledge": "autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).   The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.   Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness.   Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments.   Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

            "knowledge": "optic atrophy type 1: Optic atrophy type 1 is a condition that often causes slowly worsening vision, usually beginning in childhood. People with optic atrophy type 1 typically experience a narrowing of their field of vision (tunnel vision). Affected individuals gradually lose their sight as their field of vision becomes smaller. Both eyes are usually affected equally, but the severity of the vision loss varies widely, even among affected members of the same family, ranging from nearly normal vision to complete blindness.   In addition to vision loss, people with optic atrophy type 1 frequently have problems with color vision (color vision deficiency) that make it difficult or impossible to distinguish between shades of blue and green.   In the early stages of the condition, individuals with optic atrophy type 1 experience a progressive loss of certain cells within the retina, which is a specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. The loss of these cells (known as retinal ganglion cells) is followed by the degeneration (atrophy) of the nerves that relay visual information from the eye to the brain (optic nerves), which results in further vision loss. Atrophy causes these nerves to have an abnormally pale appearance (pallor), which can be seen during an eye examination. Optic atrophy type 1 is estimated to affect 1 in 35,000 people worldwide. This condition is more common in Denmark, where it affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people. Optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene. The protein produced from this gene is made in cells and tissues throughout the body. The OPA1 protein is found within mitochondria, which are the energy-producing centers of cells. The protein plays a key role in the organization of the shape and structure of the mitochondria and in controlled cell death (apoptosis). The OPA1 protein is also involved in a process called oxidative phosphorylation, from which cells derive much of their energy. Additionally, the protein plays a role in the maintenance of the DNA within mitochondria, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).   Mutations in the OPA1 gene lead to problems with mitochondrial function. The mitochondria become misshapen and disorganized and have reduced energy-producing capabilities. The maintenance of mtDNA may also be impaired, resulting in mtDNA mutations that further interfere with mitochondrial energy production. Cells that contain these poorly functioning mitochondria are more susceptible to apoptosis. In particular, cells that have high energy demands, such as retinal ganglion cells, die over time. Specialized extensions of retinal ganglion cells, called axons, form the optic nerves, so when retinal ganglion cells die, the optic nerves atrophy and cannot transmit visual information to the brain. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder.   In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.   In rare cases, people who have an OPA1 gene mutation do not develop optic atrophy type 1, a situation known as reduced penetrance. Delettre-Cribaillet C, Hamel CP, Lenaers G.

            "knowledge": "Optic nerve atrophy: Optic nerve atrophy is damage to the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries images of what the eye sees to the brain. There are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma.   Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include:      - Brain tumor   - Cranial arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis)   - Multiple sclerosis   - Stroke     There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Optic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually, its ability to react to light may be lost. The health care provider will do a complete eye exam to look for the condition. The exam will include tests of:     - Color vision   - Pupil light reflex   - Tonometry   - Visual acuity      You may also need a complete physical exam and other tests. Damage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed. The underlying disease must be found and treated. Otherwise, vision loss will continue.    Rarely, conditions that lead to optic atrophy may be treatable. Vision lost to optic nerve atrophy cannot be recovered. It is very important to protect the other eye. People with this condition need to be checked regularly by an eye doctor with experience in nerve-related conditions. Tell your doctor right away about any change in vision. Many causes of optic nerve atrophy cannot be prevented.   Prevention steps include:     - Older adults should have their provider carefully manage their blood pressure.   - Use standard safety precautions to prevent injuries to the face. Most facial injuries are the result of car accidents. Wearing seat belts may help prevent these injuries.   - Schedule a routine annual eye exam to check for glaucoma.   - Never drink home-brewed alcohol and forms of alcohol that are not intended for drinking. Methanol, which is found in home-brewed alcohol, can cause optic nerve atrophy in both eyes. Updated by: Franklin W. Lusby, MD, ophthalmologist, Lusby Vision Institute, La Jolla, CA.

The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma. Eye diseases, such as glaucoma, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system such as brain tumor, cranial arteritis, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults."

            "knowledge": "Optic atrophy 1: Optic atrophy 1 is a condition that mainly affects vision, but may include other features. Vision loss typically begins within the first decade of life; severity varies widely among affected people (from nearly normal vision to complete blindness), even among members of the same family. Vision problems may include difficulty distinguishing colors, progressive narrowing of the field of vision (tunnel vision) and an abnormally pale appearance (pallor) of the optic nerve. Additional, less common abnormalities may include sensorineural hearing loss , ataxia , myopathy (muscle disease) and other neurological findings. [1] It is usually caused by  mutations in the OPA1 gene , although some individuals with optic atrophy 1 do not have identified mutations in this gene, in which case the cause of the condition is unknown. This condition is inherited in an  autosomal dominant pattern but some cases result from a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. [2] Treatment focuses on individual symptoms when possible. [1] The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides the following list of features that have been reported in people with this condition. Much of the information in the HPO comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. If available, the list includes a rough estimate of how common a feature is (its frequency). Frequencies are based on a specific study and may not be representative of all studies. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary for definitions of the terms below.

Management Guidelines GeneReviews provides current, expert-authored, peer-reviewed, full-text articles describing the application of genetic testing to the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with specific inherited conditions. A thorough search of available literature provided very limited information about how optic atrophy 1 may affect life expectancy. A recent study discussed how extra-ocular neurological complications may be more common than previously thought in individuals with an OPA1 gene mutation and may affect up to 20% of individuals. The authors of the study described new clinical features including spastic paraplegia (stiffness of the legs) and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. [3] Ongoing research and follow-up of individuals with the condition may provide specific information about life expectancy in the future. Vision loss alone is not expected to substantially shorten the life span; however, severe neurological symptoms, when present, theoretically may contribute to a shortened life span in some individuals.

As the disease progresses, symptoms often spread to the wrists, knees, ankles, elbows, hips and shoulders. In most cases, symptoms occur in the same joints on both sides of your body. About 40 percent of the people who have rheumatoid arthritis also experience signs and symptoms that don't involve the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect many nonjoint structures, including: - Skin   - Eyes   - Lungs   - Heart   - Kidneys   - Salivary glands   - Nerve tissue   - Bone marrow   - Blood vessels Rheumatoid arthritis signs and symptoms may vary in severity and may even come and go. Periods of increased disease activity, called flares, alternate with periods of relative remission - when the swelling and pain fade or disappear. Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to deform and shift out of place. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have persistent discomfort and swelling in your joints.",

            "knowledge": "rheumatoid arthritis: Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease that causes chronic abnormal inflammation, primarily affecting the joints. The most common signs and symptoms are pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints. Small joints in the hands and feet are involved most often, although larger joints (such as the shoulders, hips, and knees) may become involved later in the disease. Joints are typically affected in a symmetrical pattern; for example, if joints in the hand are affected, both hands tend to be involved. People with rheumatoid arthritis often report that their joint pain and stiffness is worse when getting out of bed in the morning or after a long rest.   Rheumatoid arthritis can also cause inflammation of other tissues and organs, including the eyes, lungs, and blood vessels. Additional signs and symptoms of the condition can include a loss of energy, a low fever, weight loss, and a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Some affected individuals develop rheumatoid nodules, which are firm lumps of noncancerous tissue that can grow under the skin and elsewhere in the body.   The signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis usually appear in mid- to late adulthood. Many affected people have episodes of symptoms (flares) followed by periods with no symptoms (remissions) for the rest of their lives. In severe cases, affected individuals have continuous health problems related to the disease for many years. The abnormal inflammation can lead to severe joint damage, which limits movement and can cause significant disability. Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1.3 million adults in the United States. Worldwide, it is estimated to occur in up to 1 percent of the population. The disease is two to three times more common in women than in men, which may be related to hormonal factors. Rheumatoid arthritis probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown.   Rheumatoid arthritis is classified as an autoimmune disorder, one of a large group of conditions that occur when the immune system attacks the body's own tissues and organs. In people with rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system triggers abnormal inflammation in the membrane that lines the joints (the synovium). When the synovium is inflamed, it causes pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joint. In severe cases, the inflammation also affects the bone, cartilage, and other tissues within the joint, causing more serious damage. Abnormal immune reactions also underlie the features of rheumatoid arthritis affecting other parts of the body.   Variations in dozens of genes have been studied as risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis. Most of these genes are known or suspected to be involved in immune system function. The most significant genetic risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis are variations in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, especially the HLA-DRB1 gene. The proteins produced from HLA genes help the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders (such as viruses and bacteria). Changes in other genes appear to have a smaller impact on a person's overall risk of developing the condition.   Other, nongenetic factors are also believed to play a role in rheumatoid arthritis. These factors may trigger the condition in people who are at risk, although the mechanism is unclear. Potential triggers include changes in sex hormones (particularly in women), occupational exposure to certain kinds of dust or fibers, and viral or bacterial infections. Long-term smoking is a well-established risk factor for developing rheumatoid arthritis; it is also associated with more severe signs and symptoms in people who have the disease. The inheritance pattern of rheumatoid arthritis is unclear because many genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved. However, having a close relative with rheumatoid arthritis likely increases a person's risk of developing the condition. Carmona L, Cross M, Williams B, Lassere M, March L. Rheumatoid arthritis.

            "knowledge": "Preeclampsia (Causes): The exact cause of preeclampsia involves several factors. Experts believe it begins in the placenta - the organ that nourishes the fetus throughout pregnancy. Early in pregnancy, new blood vessels develop and evolve to efficiently send blood to the placenta. In women with preeclampsia, these blood vessels don't seem to develop or function properly. They're narrower than normal blood vessels and react differently to hormonal signaling, which limits the amount of blood that can flow through them. Causes of this abnormal development may include: - Insufficient blood flow to the uterus   - Damage to the blood vessels   - A problem with the immune system   - Certain genes Preeclampsia is classified as one of four high blood pressure disorders that can occur during pregnancy. The other three are: - Gestational hypertension. Women with gestational hypertension have high blood pressure but no excess protein in their urine or other signs of organ damage. Some women with gestational hypertension eventually develop preeclampsia.   - Chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy or that occurs before 20 weeks of pregnancy. But because high blood pressure usually doesn't have symptoms, it may be hard to determine when it began.   - Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. This condition occurs in women who have been diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure before pregnancy, but then develop worsening high blood pressure and protein in the urine or other health complications during pregnancy.",

            "knowledge": "Preeclampsia (Treatment): The only cure for preeclampsia is delivery. You're at increased risk of seizures, placental abruption, stroke and possibly severe bleeding until your blood pressure decreases. Of course, if it's too early in your pregnancy, delivery may not be the best thing for your baby. If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia, your doctor will let you know how often you'll need to come in for prenatal visits - likely more frequently than what's typically recommended for pregnancy. You'll also need more frequent blood tests, ultrasounds and nonstress tests than would be expected in an uncomplicated pregnancy. Medications Possible treatment for preeclampsia may include: - Medications to lower blood pressure. These medications, called antihypertensives, are used to lower your blood pressure if it's dangerously high. Blood pressure in the 140/90 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) range generally isn't treated. Although there are many different types of antihypertensive medications, a number of them aren't safe to use during pregnancy. Discuss with your doctor whether you need to use an antihypertensive medicine in your situation to control your blood pressure. - Corticosteroids. If you have severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome, corticosteroid medications can temporarily improve liver and platelet function to help prolong your pregnancy. Corticosteroids can also help your baby's lungs become more mature in as little as 48 hours - an important step in preparing a premature baby for life outside the womb. - Anticonvulsant medications. If your preeclampsia is severe, your doctor may prescribe an anticonvulsant medication, such as magnesium sulfate, to prevent a first seizure. Bed rest Bed rest used to be routinely recommended for women with preeclampsia. But research hasn't shown a benefit from this practice, and it can increase your risk of blood clots, as well as impact your economic and social lives. For most women, bed rest is no longer recommended. Hospitalization Severe preeclampsia may require that you be hospitalized. In the hospital, your doctor may perform regular nonstress tests or biophysical profiles to monitor your baby's well-being and measure the volume of amniotic fluid. A lack of amniotic fluid is a sign of poor blood supply to the baby. Delivery If you're diagnosed with preeclampsia near the end of your pregnancy, your doctor may recommend inducing labor right away. The readiness of your cervix - whether it's beginning to open (dilate), thin (efface) and soften (ripen) - also may be a factor in determining whether or when labor will be induced. In severe cases, it may not be possible to consider your baby's gestational age or the readiness of your cervix. If it's not possible to wait, your doctor may induce labor or schedule a C-section right away. During delivery, you may be given magnesium sulfate intravenously to prevent seizures. If you need pain-relieving medication after your delivery, ask your doctor what you should take. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve), can increase your blood pressure.",

Some estimates suggest that preeclampsia affects 2% to 8% of all pregnancies globally and about 3.4% in the United States.1,2The condition is estimated to account for 10% to 15% of maternal deaths worldwide.1 Disorders related to high blood pressure are the second leading cause of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths in developing nations.3In addition, HELLP syndrome occurs in about 10% to 20% of all women with severe preeclampsia or eclampsia.4Although preeclampsia occurs primarily in first pregnancies, a woman who had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy is seven times more likely to develop preeclampsia in a later pregnancy.5Other factors that can increase a woman's risk include:5- Chronic high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy - High blood pressure or preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy - Obesity. Overweight or obese women are also more likely to have preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy.6 - Age. Women older than 40 are at higher risk. - Multiple gestation (being pregnant with more than one fetus) - African American ethnicity. Also, among women who have had preeclampsia before, non-white women are more likely than white women to develop preeclampsia again in a later pregnancy.6 - Family history of preeclampsia. According to the World Health Organization, among women who have had preeclampsia, about 20% to 40% of their daughters and 11% to 37% of their sisters also will get the disorder.7Preeclampsia is also more common among women who have histories of certain health conditions, such as migraines,8 diabetes,9 rheumatoid arthritis,10 lupus,11 scleroderma,12 urinary tract infections,13 gum disease,14 polycystic ovary syndrome,15 multiple sclerosis, gestational diabetes, and sickle cell disease.16Preeclampsia is also more common in pregnancies resulting from egg donation, donor insemination, or in vitro fertilization.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force recommends that women who are at high risk for preeclampsia take low-dose aspirin starting after 12 weeks of pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia.17 Women who are pregnant or who are thinking about getting pregnant should talk with their health care provider about preeclampsia risk and ways to reduce the risk.",

Your doctor determines your leukemia treatment options based on your age and overall health, the type of leukemia you have, and whether it has spread to other parts of your body, including the central nervous system. Common treatments used to fight leukemia include: - Chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is the major form of treatment for leukemia. This drug treatment uses chemicals to kill leukemia cells. Depending on the type of leukemia you have, you may receive a single drug or a combination of drugs. These drugs may come in a pill form, or they may be injected directly into a vein. - Biological therapy. Biological therapy works by using treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack leukemia cells. - Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within your cancer cells. For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This can help control the disease. - Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body. You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a stem cell transplant. - Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow. Before a stem cell transplant, you receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild your bone marrow. You may receive stem cells from a donor, or in some cases you may be able to use your own stem cells. A stem cell transplant is very similar to a bone marrow transplant.",

            "knowledge": "Psoriasis (Treatment): The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and prevent infection.   Three treatment options are available:     - Skin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos. These are called topical treatments.   - Pills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin. These are called systemic, or body-wide, treatments.   - Phototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis.      TREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL)   Most of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp. These may include:     - Cortisone creams and ointments   - Creams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin   - Creams to remove the scaling (usually salicylic acid or lactic acid)   - Dandruff shampoos (over-the-counter or prescription)   - Moisturizers   - Prescription medicines containing vitamin D or vitamin A (retinoids)      SYSTEMIC (BODY-WIDE) TREATMENTS   If you have very severe psoriasis, your provider will likely recommend medicines that suppress the immune system's faulty response. These medicines include methotrexate or cyclosporine. Retinoids can also be used.   Newer drugs called biologics are used when other treatments do not work. Biologics approved for the treatment of psoriasis include:     - Adalimumab (Humira)   - Etanercept (Enbrel)   - Infliximab (Remicade)   - Ustekinumab (Stelara)   - Secukinumab (Cosentyx)   - Apremilast (Otezla)   - Ixekizumab (Taltz)      PHOTOTHERAPY   Some people may choose to have phototherapy:     - This is treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light.   - It may be given alone or after you take a drug that makes the skin sensitive to light.   - Phototherapy for psoriasis can be given as ultraviolet A (UVA) or ultraviolet B (UVB) light.      OTHER TREATMENTS   If you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics.   HOME CARE   Following these tips at home may help:      - Taking a daily bath or shower. Try not to scrub too hard because this can irritate the skin and trigger an attack.   - Oatmeal baths may be soothing and may help to loosen scales. You can use over-the-counter oatmeal bath products. Or, you can mix 1 cup (240 mL) of oatmeal into a tub (bath) of warm water.   - Keeping your skin clean and moist, and avoiding your specific psoriasis triggers may help reduce the number of flare-ups.   - Sunlight may help your symptoms go away. Be careful not to get sunburned.   - Relaxation and anti-stress techniques. The link between stress and flares of psoriasis is not well understood.   - Limiting the alcoholic beverages you drink may help keep psoriasis from getting worse.",

A problem with the immune system causes psoriasis. In a process called cell turnover, skin cells that grow deep in the skin rise to the surface. Normally, this takes a month. In psoriasis, it happens in just days because the cells rise too fast. Although symptoms may come and go, for many, psoriasis is a lifelong condition. Infections, stress, dry skin and certain medications may make symptoms worse. Psoriasis usually occurs in adults. It sometimes runs in families. Treatments include creams, medications and light therapy. [1] [2]",

Open spina bifida (myelomeningocele)—in which the spinal cord is exposed—tends to cause more severe problems. Hydrocephalus Many infants born with spina bifida get extra fluid in and around the brain, a condition called hydrocephalus, or water on the brain. The extra fluid can cause swelling of the head, which may lead to brain injury. Chiari II Malformation The brains of most children with open spina bifida are positioned abnormally. The lower part of the brain rests farther down than normal, partially in the upper spinal canal. The cerebrospinal (pronounced suh-ree-broh-SPAHYN-l) fluid can get blocked and cause hydrocephalus. While most affected children have no other symptoms, a few may have upper body weakness and trouble breathing and swallowing. Tethered Spinal Cord Typically, the bottom of the spinal cord floats freely in the spinal canal, but for many people with spina bifida, the spinal cord is attached to the spinal canal. Thus, the spinal cord stretches as a person grows, and this stretching can cause spinal nerve damage. The person might have back pain, scoliosis (crooked spine, pronounced skoh-lee-OH-sis), weakness in the legs and feet, bladder or bowel control problems, and other issues. Paralysis, Mobility Limitations People with spina bifida high on the back (near the head, for instance) might not be able to move their legs. People with spina bifida low on the back (near the hips, for example) might have some leg mobility and be able to walk unassisted or with crutches, braces, or walkers. Lack of Bladder and Bowel Control People with spina bifida often cannot control their bladder and bowel movements. They also can develop urinary tract infections. Latex Allergy Many people with spina bifida—possibly three-quarters of those with the condition—are allergic to latex, or natural rubber. While researchers still don’t entirely understand why the rate in those with spina bifida is so high, some experts believe such an allergy can be caused by frequent exposure to latex, which is common for people with spina bifida who have shunts and have had many surgeries. Learning Disabilities While at least 80% of children with open spina bifida do not have learning deficiencies, some do have learning problems. Other Conditions Some people with open spina bifida have additional physical and psychological conditions, including digestive, vision, sexual, social, and emotional problems; obesity; and depression. « Is there a cure?

            "knowledge": "Bursitis of the heel: Bursitis of the heel is swelling of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) at the back of the heel bone. A bursa acts as a cushion and lubricant between tendons or muscles sliding over bone. There are bursas around most large joints in the body, including the ankle.   The retrocalcaneal bursa is located in the back of the ankle by the heel. It is where the large Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone.   Repeated or too much use of the ankle can cause this bursa to become irritated and inflamed. It may be caused by too much walking, running, or jumping.   This condition is very often linked to Achilles tendinitis. Sometimes retrocalcaneal bursitis may be mistaken for Achilles tendinitis.   Risks for this condition include:     - Starting a very intense workout schedule   - Suddenly increasing activity level without the right conditioning   - Changes in activity level    - History of arthritis that is caused by inflammation Symptoms include:     - Pain in the heel, especially with walking, running, or when the area is touched   - Pain may get worse when rising on the toes (standing on tiptoes)   - Red, warm skin over the back of the heel Your health care provider will take a history to find out if you have symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis. An exam will be done to find the location of the pain. The provider will also look for tenderness and redness in the back of the heel.   The pain may be worse when your ankle is bent upward (dorsiflex). Or, the pain may be worse when you rise on your toes.   Most of the time, you will not need imaging studies such as x-ray and MRI at first. You may need these tests later if the first treatments DO NOT lead to improvement. Inflammation may show on a MRI. Your provider may recommend that you do the following:      - Avoid activities that cause pain.   - Put ice on the heel several times a day.   - Take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.   - Try using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.   - Try ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.      Have physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.   If these treatments DO NOT work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa. After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can break open (rupture).   If the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa. This condition most often gets better in several weeks with the proper treatment. Call your provider if you have heel pain or symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis that DO NOT improve with rest. Things you can do to prevent the problem include:     - Use proper form when exercising.   - Maintain as good flexibility and strength around the ankle to help prevent this condition.   - Stretch the Achilles tendon to help prevent injury.   - Wear shoes with enough arch support to decrease the amount of stress on the tendon and inflammation in the bursa.

It is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. You need central vision to see objects clearly and to do tasks such as reading and driving.     AMD affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die. There are two types: wet and dry. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid. Wet AMD damages the macula quickly. Blurred vision is a common early symptom. Dry AMD happens when the light-sensitive cells in the macula slowly break down. Your gradually lose your central vision. A common early symptom is that straight lines appear crooked.    Regular comprehensive eye exams can detect macular degeneration before the disease causes vision loss. Treatment can slow vision loss. It does not restore vision.    NIH: National Eye Institute",

            "knowledge": "Dehydration: Dehydration occurs when your body does not have as much water and fluids as it should.   Dehydration can be mild, moderate, or severe, based on how much of your body's fluid is lost or not replaced. Severe dehydration is a life-threatening emergency. You can become dehydrated if you lose too much fluid, do not drink enough water or fluids, or both.    Your body may lose a lot of fluid from:     - Sweating too much, for example, from exercising in hot weather   - Fever   - Vomiting or diarrhea   - Urinating too much (uncontrolled diabetes or some medications, like diuretics, can cause you to urinate a lot)      You might not drink enough fluids because:     - You do not feel like eating or drinking because you are sick   - You are nauseated   - You have a sore throat or mouth sores     Older adults and people with certain diseases, such as diabetes, are also at higher risk for dehydration. Signs of mild to moderate dehydration:      - Thirst   - Dry or sticky mouth   - Not urinating much   - Darker yellow urine   - Dry, cool skin   - Headache   - Muscle cramps      Signs of severe dehydration:     - Not urinating, or very dark yellow or amber-colored urine   - Dry, shriveled skin   - Irritability or confusion   - Dizziness or light-headedness   - Rapid heartbeat   - Rapid breathing   - Sunken eyes   - Listlessness   - Shock (not enough blood flow through the body)   - Unconsciousness or delirium Your health care provider will look for these signs of dehydration:     - Low blood pressure   - Blood pressure that drops when you stand up after lying down   - White finger tips that do not return to a pink color after your doctor presses the fingertip   - Skin that is not as elastic as normal. When the provider pinches it into a fold, it may slowly sag back into place. Normally, skin springs back right away.   - Rapid heart rate     Your doctor may do lab tests:     - Blood tests to check kidney function   - Urine tests to see what may be causing dehydration   - Other tests to see what may be causing dehydration (blood sugar test for diabetes) To treat dehydration:     - Try sipping water or sucking on ice cubes.   - Try drinking water or sports drinks that contain electrolytes.   - Do not take salt tablets. They can cause serious complications.   - Ask your provider what you should eat if you have diarrhea.      For more severe dehydration or heat emergency, you may need to stay in a hospital and receive fluid through a vein (IV). The provider will also treat the cause of the dehydration.   Dehydration caused by a stomach virus should get better on its own after a few days. If you notice signs of dehydration and treat it quickly, you should recover completely. Untreated severe dehydration may cause:     - Death   - Permanent brain damage   - Seizures You should call 911 if:      - The person loses consciousness at any time.   - There is any other change in the person's alertness (for example, confusion or seizures).   - The person has a fever over 102°F (38.8°C).   - You notice symptoms of heatstroke (such as rapid pulse or rapid breathing).   - The person's condition does not improve or gets worse despite treatment. To prevent dehydration:     - Drink plenty of fluids every day, even when you are well. Drink more when the weather is hot or you are exercising.   - If anyone in your family is ill, pay attention to how much they are able to drink. Pay close attention to children and older adults.   - Anyone with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids. DO NOT wait for signs of dehydration.   - If you think you or someone in your family may become dehydrated, call your provider. Do this before the person becomes dehydrated. Updated by: Laura J.

Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle. A weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine.

The goal is to treat your migraine symptoms right away, and to prevent symptoms by avoiding or changing your triggers.    A key step is learning how to manage your migraines at home. A headache diary can help you identify your headache triggers. Then you and your doctor can plan how to avoid these triggers.   If you have frequent migraines, your doctor may prescribe medicine to reduce the number of attacks. You need to take the medicine every day for it to be effective. Medicines may include:     - Antidepressants   - Blood pressure medicines   - Seizure medicines      Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections may also help reduce migraine attacks if they occur more than 15 days a month.   Some people find relief with minerals and vitamins. Check with your doctor to see if riboflavin or magnesium is right for you.   TREATING AN ATTACK   Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:      - Taking medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.   - Taking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.   - Too much ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or kidneys.      If these treatments do not help, ask your doctor about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections. The group of medicines most often used is called triptans.   Some migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels. If you are at risk for having a heart attack or have heart disease, talk with your doctor before using these medicines. Some migraine medicines should not be used by pregnant women. Talk with your doctor about which medicine is right for you if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.   Other medicines treat symptoms of migraine, such as nausea and vomiting. They may be used alone or along with the other drugs that treat the migraine itself.    Feverfew is an herb for migraines. It can be effective for some people. Before using feverfew, make sure your provider approves. Herbal remedies sold in drugstores and health food stores are not regulated.

            "knowledge": "vitelliform macular dystrophy: Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a genetic eye disorder that can cause progressive vision loss. This disorder affects the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, vitelliform macular dystrophy disrupts cells in a small area near the center of the retina called the macula. The macula is responsible for sharp central vision, which is needed for detailed tasks such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.   Vitelliform macular dystrophy causes a fatty yellow pigment (lipofuscin) to build up in cells underlying the macula. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become blurry or distorted. Vitelliform macular dystrophy typically does not affect side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see at night.   Researchers have described two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy with similar features. The early-onset form (known as Best disease) usually appears in childhood; the onset of symptoms and the severity of vision loss vary widely. The adult-onset form begins later, usually in mid-adulthood, and tends to cause vision loss that worsens slowly over time. The two forms of vitelliform macular dystrophy each have characteristic changes in the macula that can be detected during an eye examination. Vitelliform macular dystrophy is a rare disorder; its incidence is unknown. Mutations in the BEST1 and PRPH2 genes cause vitelliform macular dystrophy. BEST1 mutations are responsible for Best disease and for some cases of the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy. Changes in the PRPH2 gene can also cause the adult-onset form of vitelliform macular dystrophy; however, less than a quarter of all people with this form of the condition have mutations in the BEST1 or PRPH2 gene. In most cases, the cause of the adult-onset form is unknown.   The BEST1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called bestrophin. This protein acts as a channel that controls the movement of charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) into or out of cells in the retina. Mutations in the BEST1 gene probably lead to the production of an abnormally shaped channel that cannot properly regulate the flow of chloride. Researchers have not determined how these malfunctioning channels are related to the buildup of lipofuscin in the macula and progressive vision loss.   The PRPH2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called peripherin 2. This protein is essential for the normal function of light-sensing (photoreceptor) cells in the retina. Mutations in the PRPH2 gene cause vision loss by disrupting structures in these cells that contain light-sensing pigments. It is unclear why PRPH2 mutations affect only central vision in people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy. Best disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person has one parent with the condition.   The inheritance pattern of adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy is uncertain. Some studies have suggested that this disorder may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It is difficult to be sure, however, because many affected people have no history of the disorder in their family, and only a small number of affected families have been reported.

[2] Management usually includes a comprehensive eye examination once or twice a year to monitor progression of the disease and for complications such as choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ). [4]  CNV is sometimes associated with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy because macular degeneration can damage the retinal layers. When this happens, the vascular layer of the eye between the sclera and the retina known as the choroid may produce new blood vessels (neovascularization) which grow up through the damaged layers and leak or bleed into the retina. This can cause vision loss on its own. If CNV does develop, anti-VEGF therapy such as Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab can control and even reverse the CNV. However anti-VEGF therapy does not stop or reverse the vision loss caused by adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy, only the extra vision loss that is due to also developing CNV. [2]  Although vision loss is usually slow, when vision is impaired significantly, people with adult-onset vitelliform macular dystrophy may be referred for low vision testing and rehabilitation. Low vision rehabilitation can help maintain and optimize reading ability and improve overall quality of life. [4] [5]",

            "knowledge": "Williams syndrome: Williams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development. It is passed down in families (inherited). Williams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of several genes. Parents may not have any family history of the condition. However, people with Williams syndrome have a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of their children. It often occurs randomly.   Williams syndrome occurs in about 1 in 8,000 births.   One of the 25 missing genes is the gene that produces elastin, a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition. Symptoms of Williams syndrome are:     - Delayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing   - Developmental delay   - Easily distracted, attention deficit disorder (ADD)   - Feeding problems including colic, reflux, and vomiting   - Inward bend of the small finger   - Learning disorders   - Mild to moderate intellectual disability   - Personality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music   - Short, compared to the rest of the person's family   - Sunken chest     The face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show:     - A flattened nasal bridge with small upturned nose   - Long ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip   - Prominent lips with an open mouth   - Skin that covers the inner corner of the eye   - Partially missing teeth, defective tooth enamel, or small, widely spaced teeth Signs include:     - Narrowing of some blood vessels   - Farsightedness   - High blood calcium level that may cause seizures and rigid muscles   - High blood pressure   - Slack joints that may change to stiffness as the person gets older   - Unusual star-like pattern in iris of the eye     Tests for Williams syndrome include:     - Blood pressure check   - Blood test for a missing piece of chromosome 7 (FISH test)   - Echocardiography combined with Doppler ultrasound   - Kidney ultrasound There is no cure for Williams syndrome. Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium, if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. It is treated based on how severe it is.   Physical therapy is helpful to people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other weaknesses. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms.   It can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome. A support group can be helpful for emotional support and for giving and receiving practical advice.

            "knowledge": "What is COPD?: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a progressive lung disease in which the airways of the lungs become damaged, making it hard to breathe. You may also have heard COPD called other names, like emphysema or chronic bronchitis. In people who have COPD, the airways that carry air in and out of the lungs are partially blocked, making it difficult to get air in and out. COPD is a major cause of death and illness throughout the world. It kills more than 120,000 Americans each year. That's one death every 4 minutes. How COPD Affects Airways The \"airways\" are the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs through the nose and mouth. The airways of the lungs branch out like an upside-down tree. At the end of each branch are many small, balloon-like air sacs. In healthy people, the airways and air sacs are elastic (stretchy). When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon, and when you breathe out, the balloon deflates and the air goes out. In people with COPD, the airways and air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. Less air gets in and less air goes out of the airways because - The airways and air sacs lose their elasticity like an old rubber band.  - The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed.  - The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed or swollen.  - Cells in the airways make more mucus or sputum than usual, which tends to clog the airways.

COPD Develops Slowly, Has No Cure When COPD is severe, shortness of breath and other symptoms of COPD can get in the way of even the most basic tasks, such as doing light housework, taking a walk, even washing and dressing. COPD develops slowly, and it may be many years before you notice symptoms like feeling short of breath. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older people. There is no cure for COPD. The damage to your airways and lungs cannot be reversed, but there are things you can do to control the disabling effects of the disease. COPD is not contagious. You cannot catch it from someone else.",

At first, COPD may cause no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, symptoms usually become more severe. They include       - A cough that produces a lot of mucus    - Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity    - Wheezing    - Chest tightness       Doctors use lung function tests, imaging tests, and blood tests to diagnose COPD.

            "knowledge": "COPD: Español   Also known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic bronchitis; or emphysema. COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. Progressive means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of a slimy substance called mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. However, up to 25 percent of people with COPD never smoked. Long-term exposure to other lung irritants—such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dusts—also may contribute to COPD. A rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency can also cause the disease. Overview To understand COPD, it helps to understand how the lungs work. The air that you breathe goes down your windpipe into tubes in your lungs called bronchial tubes or airways. Within the lungs, your bronchial tubes branch many times into thousands of smaller, thinner tubes called bronchioles. These tubes end in bunches of tiny round air sacs called alveoli. Small blood vessels called capillaries run along the walls of the air sacs. When air reaches the air sacs, oxygen passes through the air sac walls into the blood in the capillaries. At the same time, a waste product, called carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, moves from the capillaries into the air sacs. This process, called gas exchange, brings in oxygen for the body to use for vital functions and removes the CO2. The airways and air sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate and the air goes out. In COPD, less air flows in and out of the airways because of one or more of the following: The airways and air sacs lose their elastic quality. The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed. The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed. The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged. Normal Lungs and Lungs With COPD In the United States, the term COPD includes two main conditions—emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs are damaged. As a result, the air sacs lose their shape and become floppy. This damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. If this happens, the amount of gas exchange in the lungs is reduced. In chronic bronchitis, the lining of the airways stays constantly irritated and inflamed, and this causes the lining to swell. Lots of thick mucus forms in the airways, making it hard to breathe. Most people who have COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but the severity of each condition varies from person to person. Thus, the general term COPD is more accurate. Outlook COPD is a major cause of disability, and it is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Currently, 16 million people are diagnosed with COPD. Many more people may have the disease and not even know it. COPD develops slowly. Symptoms often worsen over time and can limit your ability to do routine activities. Severe COPD may prevent you from doing even basic activities like walking, cooking, or taking care of yourself. Most of the time, COPD is diagnosed in middle-aged or older adults. The disease is not contagious, meaning it cannot be passed from person to person. COPD has no cure yet, and doctors do not know how to reverse the damage to the lungs. However, treatments and lifestyle changes can help you feel better, stay more active, and slow the progress of the disease.",

            "knowledge": "Epilepsy: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activity—from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development—can lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy. Once epilepsy is diagnosed, it is important to begin treatment as soon as possible. For about 70 percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy, seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. Some drugs are more effective for specific types of seizures. An individual with seizures, particularly those that are not easily controlled, may want to see a neurologist specifically trained to treat epilepsy. In some children, special diets may help to control seizures when medications are either not effective or cause serious side effects. While epilepsy cannot be cured, for some people the seizures can be controlled with medication, diet, devices, and/or surgery. Most seizures do not cause brain damage, but ongoing uncontrolled seizures may cause brain damage. It is not uncommon for people with epilepsy, especially children, to develop behavioral and emotional problems in conjunction with seizures. Issues may also arise as a result of the stigma attached to having epilepsy, which can led to embarrassment and frustration or bullying, teasing, or avoidance in school and other social settings. For many people with epilepsy, the risk of seizures restricts their independence (some states refuse drivers licenses to people with epilepsy) and recreational activities. Epilepsy can be a life-threatening condition. Some people with epilepsy are at special risk for abnormally prolonged seizures or sudden unexplained death in epilepsy.",

            "knowledge": "Congenital heart defects in children (Risk factors): Most congenital heart defects result from problems early in your child's heart development, the cause of which is unknown. However, certain environmental and genetic risk factors may play a role. They include: - Rubella (German measles). Having rubella during pregnancy can cause problems in your baby's heart development. Your doctor can test you for immunity to this viral disease before pregnancy and vaccinate you against it if you aren't immune.   - Diabetes. You can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects by carefully controlling your diabetes before attempting to conceive and during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes generally doesn't increase your baby's risk of developing a heart defect.   -   Medications. Certain medications taken during pregnancy may cause birth defects, including congenital heart defects. Give your doctor a complete list of medications you take before attempting to become pregnant.  Medications known to increase the risk of congenital heart defects include thalidomide (Thalomid), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, statins, the acne medication isotretinoin (Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis) and lithium.    - Drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Avoid alcohol during pregnancy because it increases the risk of congenital heart defects.   - Smoking. Smoking during pregnancy increases the likelihood of a congenital heart defect in the baby.   -   Heredity. Congenital heart defects sometimes run in families and may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Many children with Down syndrome - which is caused by an extra 21st chromosome (trisomy 21) - have heart defects. A missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 22 also causes heart defects.  Genetic testing can detect such disorders during fetal development. If you already have a child with a congenital heart defect, a genetic counselor can estimate the odds that your next child will have one.",

The signs and symptoms are usually more severe in males than in females, although the features of this disorder range from very mild to severe in affected women.   Males with Coffin-Lowry syndrome typically have severe to profound intellectual disability and delayed development. Affected women may be cognitively normal, or they may have intellectual disability ranging from mild to profound. Beginning in childhood or adolescence, some people with this condition experience brief episodes of collapse when excited or startled by a loud noise. These attacks are called stimulus-induced drop episodes (SIDEs).   Most affected males and some affected females have distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, widely spaced and downward-slanting eyes, a short nose with a wide tip, and a wide mouth with full lips. These features become more pronounced with age. Soft hands with short, tapered fingers are also characteristic of Coffin-Lowry syndrome. Additional features of this condition include short stature, an unusually small head (microcephaly), progressive abnormal curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), and other skeletal abnormalities. The incidence of this condition is uncertain, but researchers estimate that the disorder affects 1 in 40,000 to 50,000 people. Mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene cause Coffin-Lowry syndrome.

Characteristic facial features may include an underdeveloped upper jaw bone (maxillary hypoplasia), a broad nose, protruding nostrils (nares), an abnormally prominent brow, down-slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism), large low-set ears, and unusually thick eyebrows. Skeletal abnormalities may include abnormal front-to-back and side-to-side curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), unusual prominence of the breastbone (pigeon chest, or pectus carinatum), dental abnormalities, and short, hyperextensible, tapered fingers. Other features may include feeding and respiratory problems, developmental delay, hearing impairment, awkward gait, stimulus-induced drop episodes, and heart and kidney involvement. The disorder affects males and females in equal numbers, but symptoms are usually more severe in males. The disorder is caused by a defective gene, RSK2, which is found in 1996 on the X chromosome (Xp22.2-p22.1). Thus, the syndrome is typically more severe in males because males have only one X chromosome, while females have two.

Achondroplasia is one of a group of disorders called chondrodystrophies, or osteochondrodysplasias.   Achondroplasia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, which means that if a child gets the defective gene from 1 parent, the child will have the disorder. If 1 parent has achondroplasia, the infant has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. If both parents have the condition, the infant's chances of being affected increase to 75%.   However, most cases appear as spontaneous mutations. This means that 2 parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition. The typical appearance of achondroplastic dwarfism can be seen at birth. Symptoms may include:      - Abnormal hand appearance with persistent space between the long and ring fingers   - Bowed legs   - Decreased muscle tone   - Disproportionately large head-to-body size difference   - Prominent forehead (frontal bossing)   - Shortened arms and legs (especially the upper arm and thigh)   - Short stature (significantly below the average height for a person of the same age and sex)   - Narrowing of the spinal column spinal stenosis   - Spine curvatures called kyphosis and lordosis During pregnancy, a prenatal ultrasound may show excessive amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn infant.   Examination of the infant after birth shows increased front-to-back head size. There may be signs of hydrocephalus (\"water on the brain\").   X-rays of the long bones can reveal achondroplasia in the newborn. There is no specific treatment for achondroplasia. Related abnormalities, including spinal stenosis and spinal cord compression, should be treated when they cause problems. People with achondroplasia seldom reach 5 feet (1.5 meters) in height. Intelligence is in the normal range. Infants who receive the abnormal gene from both parents do not often live beyond a few months. Health problems that may develop include:     - Breathing problems from a small upper airway and from pressure on the area of the brain that controls breathing   - Lung problems from a small ribcage If there is a family history of achondroplasia and you plan to have children, you may find it helpful to speak to your health care provider. Genetic counseling may be helpful for prospective parents when 1 or both have achondroplasia. However, because achondroplasia most often develops spontaneously, prevention is not always possible.

Exposure to dusts, fumes, strong acids, and other chemicals in the air causes this type of bronchitis. Smoking may also contribute.   You may be at risk if you are exposed to dusts that contain:     - Asbestos   - Coal   - Cotton   - Flax   - Latex   - Metals   - Silica   - Talc   - Toluene diisocyanate   - Western red cedar Symptoms may include any of the following:     - Cough that brings up mucus (sputum)   - Shortness of breath   - Wheezing The health care provider will listen to your lungs using a stethoscope. Wheezing sounds or crackles may be heard.   Tests that may be ordered include:     - Chest CT scan   - Chest x-ray   - Pulmonary function tests (to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning) The goal of treatment is to reduce the irritation.   Getting more air into the workplace or wearing masks to filter out the offending dust particles may help. Some people may need to be taken out of the workplace.   Some cases of industrial bronchitis go away without treatment. Other times, a person may need inhaled anti-inflammatory medicines. If you are at risk or have experienced this problem and you smoke, stop smoking.   Helpful measures include:     - Breathing humidified air   - Increasing fluid intake   - Resting The outcome may be good as long as you can stop being exposed to the irritant. Chronic disability from industrial bronchitis is rare. Continued exposure to irritating gases, fumes, or other substances can lead to permanent lung damage. Call your provider if you are regularly exposed to dusts, fumes, strong acids, or other chemicals that can affect the lungs and you develop symptoms of bronchitis. Control dust in industrial settings by wearing face masks and protective clothing, and by treating textiles. Stop smoking if you are at risk.   Get early screening by a doctor if you are exposed to chemicals that can cause this condition.

            "knowledge": "Bronchitis (Living With): If you have chronic bronchitis, you can take steps to control your symptoms. Lifestyle changes and ongoing care can help you manage the condition. Lifestyle Changes The most important step is to not start smoking or to quit smoking. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. For more information about how to quit smoking, go to the Diseases and Conditions Index Smoking and Your Heart article and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI's) \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart.\" Although these resources focus on heart health, they include general information about how to quit smoking. Also, try to avoid other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, dust, fumes, vapors, and air pollution. This will help keep your lungs healthy. Wash your hands often to lower your risk for a viral or bacterial infection. Also, try to stay away from people who have colds or the flu. See your doctor right away if you have signs or symptoms of a cold or the flu. Follow a healthy diet and be as physically active as you can. A healthy diet includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. It also includes lean meats, poultry, fish, and fat-free or low-fat milk or milk products. A healthy diet also is low in saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium (salt), and added sugar. For more information about following a healthy diet, go to the NHLBI's Aim for a Healthy Weight Web site, \"Your Guide to a Healthy Heart,\" and \"Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH.\" All of these resources include general advice about healthy eating. Ongoing Care See your doctor regularly and take all of your medicines as prescribed. Also, talk with your doctor about getting a yearly flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If you have chronic bronchitis, you may benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. People who have chronic bronchitis often breathe fast. Talk with your doctor about a breathing method called pursed-lip breathing. This method decreases how often you take breaths, and it helps keep your airways open longer. This allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs so you can be more physically active. To do pursed-lip breathing, you breathe in through your nostrils. Then you slowly breathe out through slightly pursed lips, as if you're blowing out a candle. You exhale two to three times longer than you inhale. Some people find it helpful to count to two while inhaling and to four or six while exhaling.",

            "knowledge": "What are the treatments for Bronchitis - acute?: Most people DO NOT need antibiotics for acute bronchitis. The infection will almost always go away on its own within 1 week. Doing these things may help you feel better:  - Drink plenty of fluids.  - If you have asthma or another chronic lung condition, use your inhaler.  - Get plenty of rest.  - Take aspirin or acetaminophen (Tylenol and other brands) if you have a fever. Do not give aspirin to children.  - Use a humidifier or steam in the bathroom.   Certain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can help break up or loosen mucus. Look for the word \"guaifenesin\" on the label. Ask the pharmacist if you need help finding it.   If your symptoms do not improve or if you are wheezing, your doctor may prescribe an inhaler to open your airways.  If your doctor thinks you also have bacteria in your airways, he or she may prescribe antibiotics. This medicine will only get rid of bacteria, not viruses. A bacterial infection is more common if you also have a chronic lung disease like COPD.  Sometimes, bacteria may infect the airways along with the virus. If your doctor thinks this has happened, you may be prescribed antibiotics. Sometimes, corticosteroid medicine is also needed to reduce inflammation in the lungs.  Other tips include:  - Do not smoke.  - Avoid secondhand smoke and air pollution.  - Wash your hands (and your children's hands) often to avoid spreading viruses and other germs.",

            "knowledge": "Dengue fever (Summary): The following summary is from Orphanet, a European reference portal for information on rare diseases and orphan drugs. Orpha Number: 99828 Disease definition Dengue fever (DF), caused by dengue virus , is an arboviral disease characterized by an initial non-specific febrile illness that can sometimes progress to more severe forms manifesting capillary leakage and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever, or DHF) and shock (dengue shock syndrome , or DSS). Epidemiology DF is found in the tropics worldwide, especially in Southeast Asia, the Pacific region, and the Americas, with 40% of the global population at risk. An estimated 50 to 100 million cases of DF, 500,000 hospitalizations, and 20,000 deaths occur yearly worldwide. Clinical description The vast majority of dengue virus infections result in DF, which is characterized by sudden onset of fever, malaise, headache (classically retro-orbital), and myalgia/arthralgia, often followed soon after by a petechial rash, which may be pruritic. In most cases, symptoms will resolve within 7 days without further complications. However, in a small minority of patients, a brief period of deffervescence is followed by worsening abdominal symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage (DHF: epistaxis, bleeding gums, gastrointestinal bleeding) and a capillary leak syndrome (DSS: hemoconcentration, hypoalbuminemia, pleural effusion, shock). DHF/DSS are seen most often in children under the age of 15 years. Risk is greater with secondary heterologous infection by one of the four dengue virus serotypes, but severe disease may be seen with first infections. Etiology Over 25 different viruses cause viral hemorrhagic fever. Dengue virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus. Four distinct serotypes, with significant strain variation, are recognized. Dengue viruses are maintained in humans and transmitted between them by the bite of infected mosquitoes, most commonly Aedes aegypti but also Aedes albopictus). Person-to-person transmission has not been reported. Diagnostic methods Common diagnostic modalities include serologic testing by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Virus isolation may also be performed in specialized laboratories. The viremic phase of DF/DHF is usually brief (first 3-5 days of illness), after which time detection of anti-dengue IgM antibodies , which appear as early as 2-4 days after disease onset, is the mainstay. Numerous commercial ELISA assays are available with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Differential diagnosis DF is difficult to distinguish from a host of other febrile illnesses such as malaria and typhoid fever (see these terms), especially early in the course of disease before the rash appears. For DHF/DSS, other viral hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, rickettsial infection (see these terms) and meningococcemia need to be excluded. Management and treatment As there is presently no antiviral drug available for DF/DHF, treatment is supportive, following the guidelines for treatment of severe septicemia. Insecticide-treated bed nets, room screens and elimination of larval development sites should be used in open-air settings to prevent further transmission. Prognosis Case-fatality rates for DF are less than 1% but may rise to as high as 40% in DHF/DSS, largely dependent upon whether access to advanced medical care exists. Children and persons with underlying chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma are at increased risk. The most severe phase of disease usually lasts only a few days and survivors generally have no lasting sequelae. Visit the Orphanet disease page for more resources.",

Your doctor may perform tests to identify of the staph bacteria behind your infection, and to help choose the antibiotic that will work best. Antibiotics commonly prescribed to treat staph infections include certain cephalosporins, nafcillin or related antibiotics, sulfa drugs, or vancomycin. Vancomycin increasingly is required to treat serious staph infections because so many strains of staph bacteria have become resistant to other traditional medicines. But vancomycin and some other antibiotics have to be given intravenously. If you're given an oral antibiotic, be sure to take it as directed, and to finish all of the medication prescribed by your doctor. Ask your doctor what signs and symptoms you should watch for that might indicate your infection is worsening. - Wound drainage. If you have a skin infection, your doctor will likely make an incision into the sore to drain fluid that has collected there. - Device removal. If your infection involves a device or prosthetic, prompt removal of the device is needed. For some devices, removal might require surgery. Antibiotic resistance Staph bacteria are very adaptable, and many varieties have become resistant to one or more antibiotics. For example, only about 10 percent of today's staph infections can be cured with penicillin. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of staph bacteria - often described as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains - has led to the use of IV antibiotics, such as vancomycin, with the potential for more side effects, such as vancomycin.",

These Alzheimer's disease medications, such as rivastigmine (Exelon), work by increasing the levels of chemical messengers believed to be important for memory, thought and judgment (neurotransmitters) in the brain. This can help improve alertness and cognition, and may help reduce hallucinations and other behavioral problems. Possible side effects may include gastrointestinal upset, excessive salivation and tearing, and frequent urination. These are not FDA approved for Lewy body dementia. - Parkinson's disease medications. These medications, such as carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) may help reduce parkinsonian symptoms, such as rigid muscles and slow movement. However, these medications may also increase confusion, hallucinations and delusions. - Medications to treat other symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat other symptoms associated with Lewy body dementia, such as sleep or movement problems. If possible, avoid medications with anticholinergic properties, which can worsen cognition or dopamine agonists, which can cause hallucinations. First-generation antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol (Haldol), should not be used to treat Lewy body dementia. They may cause severe confusion, severe Parkinsonism, sedation and sometimes even death. Very rarely, certain second-generation antipsychotics may be prescribed for a short time at a low dose but only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Therapies Because antipsychotic drugs can worsen Lewy body dementia symptoms, it might be helpful to initially try nondrug approaches, such as: - Tolerating the behavior. Many times a person with Lewy body dementia isn't distressed by the hallucinations. In these cases, the side effects of medication may be worse than the hallucinations themselves. - Modifying the environment. Reducing clutter and distracting noise can make it easier for someone with dementia to function. - Offering soothing responses. A caregiver's response may worsen behavior. Avoid correcting and quizzing a person with dementia. Offer reassurance and validation of his or her concerns. - Creating daily routines and keeping tasks simple. Break tasks into easier steps and focus on successes, not failures. Structure and routine during the day can be less confusing.",

            "knowledge": "autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness: Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is a disorder of the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. People with this condition typically have difficulty seeing and distinguishing objects in low light (night blindness). For example, they may not be able to identify road signs at night or see stars in the night sky. They also often have other vision problems, including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity), nearsightedness (myopia), involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus), and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus).   The vision problems associated with this condition are congenital, which means they are present from birth. They tend to remain stable (stationary) over time. Autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness is likely a rare disease; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in several genes can cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness. Each of these genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in the retina. These proteins are involved in sending (transmitting) visual signals from cells called rods, which are specialized for vision in low light, to cells called bipolar cells, which relay the signals to other retinal cells. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain.   Mutations in two genes, GRM6 and TRPM1, cause most cases of this condition. These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are necessary for bipolar cells to receive and relay signals. Mutations in other genes involved in the same bipolar cell signaling pathway are likely responsible for a small percentage of cases of autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness.   Gene mutations that cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness disrupt the transmission of visual signals between rod cells and bipolar cells or interfere with the bipolar cells' ability to pass on these signals. As a result, visual information received by rod cells cannot be effectively transmitted to the brain, leading to difficulty seeing in low light. The cause of the other vision problems associated with this condition is unclear. It has been suggested that the mechanisms that underlie night blindness can interfere with other visual systems, causing myopia, reduced visual acuity, and other impairments.   Some people with autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness have no identified mutation in any of the known genes. The cause of the disorder in these individuals is unknown. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

            "knowledge": "Dementia: Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness.  Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brain’s oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems.  Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process. Drugs to specifically treat Alzheimer’s disease and some other progressive dementias are now available.  Although these drugs do not halt the disease or reverse existing brain damage, they can improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. This may improve an individual’s quality of life, ease the burden on caregivers, or delay admission to a nursing home. Many researchers are also examining whether these drugs may be useful for treating other types of dementia.  Many people with dementia, particularly those in the early stages, may benefit from practicing tasks designed to improve performance in specific aspects of cognitive functioning. For example, people can sometimes be taught to use memory aids, such as mnemonics, computerized recall devices, or note taking. There are many disorders that can cause dementia. Some, such as Alzheimer’s disease or Huntington’s disease, lead to a progressive loss of mental functions. But other types of dementia can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. People with moderate or advanced dementia typically need round-the-clock care and supervision to prevent them from harming themselves or others. They also may need assistance with daily activities such as eating, bathing, and dressing.",

            "knowledge": "Dementia (WHAT IS VASCULAR DEMENTIA?): Vascular dementia, considered the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) result from injuries to the vessels supplying blood to the brain, often after a stroke or series of strokes. Vascular dementia and VCI arise as a result of risk factors that similarly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (such as stroke), including atrial fibrillation, hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes, and high cholesterol. The symptoms of vascular dementia can be similar to those of Alzheimer's, and both conditions can occur at the same time. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve during one's lifetime.This type of dementia is often managed with drugs to prevent strokes. The aim is to reduce the risk of additional brain damage. Some studies suggest that drugs that improve memory in Alzheimer's disease might benefit people with early vascular dementia. Interventions that address risk factors may be incorporated into the management of vascular dementia.Some types of vascular dementia include:Multi-infarct dementia. This type of dementia occurs when a person has had many small strokes that damage brain cells. One side of the body may be disproportionally affected, and multi-infarct dementia may impair language or other functions, depending on the region of the brain that is affected. When the strokes occur on both sides of the brain, dementia is more likely than when stroke occurs on one side of the brain. In some cases, a single stroke can damage the brain enough to cause dementia. This so-called single-infarct dementia is more common when stroke affects the left side of the brain-where speech centers are located-and/or when it involves the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is vital for memory.Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This inherited form of cardiovascular disease results in a thickening of the walls of small- and medium-sized blood vessels, eventually stemming the flow of blood to the brain. It is associated with mutations of a gene called Notch3. CADASIL is associated with multi-infarct dementia, stroke, migraine with aura (migraine preceded by visual symptoms), and mood disorders. The first symptoms can appear in people between ages 20 and 40. Many people with CADASIL are undiagnosed. People with first-degree relatives who have CADASIL can be tested for genetic mutations to the Notch3 gene to determine their own risk of developing CADASIL.Subcortical vascular dementia, also called Binswanger's disease. This rare form of dementia involves extensive damage to the small blood vessels and nerve fibers that make up white matter, the \"network\" part of the brain believed to be critical for relaying messages between regions. The symptoms of Binswanger's are related to the disruption of subcortical neural circuits involving short-term memory, organization, mood, attention, decision making, and appropriate behavior. A characteristic feature of this disease is psychomotor slowness, such as an increase in the time it takes for a person to think of a letter and then write it on a piece of paper.For more information about vascular dementia and VCI, see NIA's list of resources.",

            "knowledge": "Diabetes (Causes): Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar. Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to insulin, or both.   To understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested:     - A sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.   - An organ called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and liver cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.        People with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, and/or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because either:     - Their pancreas does not make enough insulin   - Their cells do not respond to insulin normally   - Both of the above      There are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:       - Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause is unknown.   - Type 2 diabetes is much more common. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it. With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should.   - There are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2.      Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar that develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not have diabetes.   If your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you may be more likely to develop the disease.",

            "knowledge": "Burns (Treatment): Treatment of burns depends on the type and extent of the injuries. Most minor burns can be treated at home using over-the-counter products or aloe. They usually heal within a few weeks. For serious burns, after appropriate first aid care and wound assessment, your treatment may involve medications, wound dressings, therapy and surgery. The goals of treatment are to control pain, remove dead tissue, prevent infection, reduce scarring, regain function and address emotional needs. You may need months of additional treatments and therapy. This may be done during a hospital stay, on an outpatient basis or at home. Factors affecting this choice include your wishes, other conditions and abilities, such as whether you're able to change bandages. Medications and wound healing products For major burns, various medications and products are used to encourage healing. - Water-based treatments. Your care team may use techniques such as ultrasound mist therapy to clean and stimulate the wound tissue. - Fluids to prevent dehydration. You may need intravenous (IV) fluids to prevent dehydration and organ failure. - Pain and anxiety medications. Healing burns can be incredibly painful. You may need morphine and anti-anxiety medications - particularly for dressing changes. - Burn creams and ointments. Your care team can select from a variety of topical products for wound healing. These help keep the wound moist, reduce pain, prevent infection and speed healing. - Dressings. Your care team may also use various specialty wound dressings. These create a moist environment that fights infection and helps the burn heal. - Drugs that fight infection. If you develop an infection, you may need IV antibiotics. - Tetanus shot. Your doctor might recommend a tetanus shot after a burn injury. Physical and occupational therapy If the burned area is large, especially if it covers any joints, you may need physical therapy exercises. These can help stretch the skin so the joints can remain flexible. Other types of exercises can improve muscle strength and coordination. And occupational therapy may help if you have difficulty doing your normal daily activities. Surgical and other procedures You may need one or more of the following procedures: - Breathing assistance. If you've been burned on the face or neck, your throat may swell shut. If that appears likely, your doctor may insert a tube down your windpipe (trachea) to keep oxygen supplied to your lungs. - Tube feeding. Your metabolism goes into overdrive when your body starts trying to heal your burns. To provide adequate nutrition for this task, you doctor may thread a feeding tube through your nose to your stomach. - Easing blood flow around the wound. If a burn scab (eschar) goes completely around a limb, it can tighten and cut off the blood circulation. A scab (eschar) that goes completely around the chest can make it difficult to breathe. Your doctor may cut the eschar in several places to relieve this pressure. This procedure is called decompression. - Skin grafts. A skin graft is a surgical procedure in which sections of your own healthy skin are used to replace the scar tissue caused by deep burns. Donor skin from cadavers or pigs can be used as a temporary solution. - Plastic surgery. Plastic surgery (reconstruction) can improve the appearance of burn scars and increase the flexibility of joints affected by scarring.",

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or lupus) is an autoimmune disease. This means there is a problem with the body's immune system.   Normally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues.   SLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead lead to disorders such as interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis. Over time, kidney failure can result. Symptoms of lupus nephritis include:     - Blood in the urine   - Foamy appearance to urine   - High blood pressure   - Swelling of any area of the body A physical exam shows signs of decreased kidney functioning with body swelling (edema). Blood pressure may be high. Abnormal sounds may be heard when the doctor listens to your heart and lungs.   Tests that may be done include:     - ANA titer   - BUN and creatinine   - Complement levels   - Urinalysis   - Urine protein   - Kidney biopsy, to determine appropriate treatment The goal of treatment is to improve kidney function and to delay kidney failure.   Medicines may include drugs that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine.   You may need dialysis to control symptoms of kidney failure, sometimes for only a while. A kidney transplant may be recommended. People with active lupus should not have a transplant because the condition can occur in the transplanted kidney. How well you do, depends on the specific form of lupus nephritis. You may have flare-ups, and then times when you do not have any symptoms.    Some people with this condition develop chronic kidney failure.   Although lupus nephritis may return in a transplanted kidney, it rarely leads to end-stage kidney disease. Complications that may result from lupus nephritis include:     - Acute renal failure   - Chronic renal failure Call your health care provider if you have blood in the urine or swelling of your body.   If you have lupus nephritis, call your provider if you notice decreased urine output. Treating lupus may help prevent or delay onset of lupus nephritis.

            "knowledge": "Pelvic organ prolapse: Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles and tissues supporting the pelvic organs (the uterus, bladder, or rectum) become weak or loose. This allows one or more of the pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina. Many women are embarrassed to talk to their doctor about their symptoms or think that their symptoms are normal. But pelvic organ prolapse is treatable. The pelvic muscles and tissues support the pelvic organs like a hammock. The pelvic organs include the bladder, uterus and cervix, vagina, and rectum, which is part of the bowel. A prolapse happens when the pelvis muscles and tissues can no longer support these organs because the muscles and tissues are weak or damaged. This causes one or more pelvic organs to drop or press into or out of the vagina.  Pelvic organ prolapse is a type of pelvic floor disorder. The most common pelvic floor disorders are: The different types of pelvic organ prolapse depend on the pelvic organ affected. The most common types include:  Although it is rare, pelvic organ prolapse can also happen after a hysterectomy. Any part of the vaginal wall may drop, causing a bulge into or out of the vagina. Pelvic floor disorders (urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse) affect one in five women in the United States.1 Pelvic organ prolapse is less common than urinary or fecal incontinence but affects almost 3% of U.S. women.1 Pelvic organ prolapse happens more often in older women and in white and Hispanic women than in younger women or women of other racial and ethnic groups.2,3  Some women develop more than one pelvic floor disorder, such as pelvic organ prolapse with urinary incontinence. The pressure from prolapse can cause a bulge in the vagina that can sometimes be felt or seen. Women with pelvic organ prolapse may feel uncomfortable pressure during physical activity or sex.  Other symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse include:  Some women say that their symptoms are worse at certain times of the day, during physical activity, or after standing for a long time. Talk to your doctor or nurse about your symptoms. Pelvic organ prolapse happens when the muscles or connective tissues of the pelvis do not work as they should. The most common risk factors are: Your doctor will talk to you about your symptoms and do a pelvic exam. You may be asked to strain or cough during the exam so your doctor can see whether these actions cause prolapse or urine leakage. Your doctor may also do other tests to see whether you can completely empty your bladder when you go to the bathroom. Treatment for pelvic organ prolapse depends on the type of prolapse you have, your symptoms, your age, other health problems, and whether you are sexually active.  Your treatment may include one or more of the following: Researchers are studying ways to prevent pelvic organ prolapse.

Other factors also can affect the pulmonary arteries and cause PH. For example, the condition may develop if: The walls of the arteries tighten. The walls of the arteries are stiff at birth or become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. Blood clots form in the arteries. These changes make it hard for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. Thus, the pressure in the arteries rises, causing PH. Many factors can contribute to the process that leads to the different types of PH. Group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may have no known cause, or the condition may be inherited. (\"Inherited\" means the condition is passed from parents to children through genes.) Some diseases and conditions also can cause group 1 PAH. Examples include HIV infection, congenital heart disease, and sickle cell disease. Also, the use of street drugs (such as cocaine) and certain diet medicines can lead to PAH.

            "knowledge": "Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension   - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension   - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins   - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease)   - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease   - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema   - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium)   - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders   - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders   - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis   - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease   - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension.",

            "message": "The heart has two upper chambers and two lower chambers. When blood passes through the heart, the lower right chamber pumps blood to your lungs through the pulmonary artery. Once in the lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The blood then flows through blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of the heart. However, with pulmonary hypertension, the walls of the arteries become stiff and thick. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries."

Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body.   When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension.   The heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger. This condition is called right-sided heart failure, or cor pulmonale.   Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by:     - Autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis   - Birth defects of the heart   - Blood clots in the lung (pulmonary embolism)   - Heart failure   - Heart valve disease   - HIV infection   - Low oxygen levels in the blood for a long time (chronic)   - Lung disease, such as COPD or pulmonary fibrosis   - Medicines (for example, certain diet drugs)   - Obstructive sleep apnea     In rare cases, the cause of pulmonary hypertension is unknown. In this case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Idiopathic means the cause of a disease is not known. IPAH affects more women than men.   If pulmonary hypertension is caused by a known medicine or medical condition, it is called secondary pulmonary hypertension.",

Medicines and fluids pass through this IV.   - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain.   - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots.   - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks.       EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart.      - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack.   - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again.      You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital.   Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery.    TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK    After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital.   You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly.    While under the care of your health care team, you will learn:     - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks   - How to eat a heart-healthy diet   - How to be active and exercise safely   - What to do when you have chest pain   - How to stop smoking      Strong emotions are common after a heart attack.     - You may feel sad   - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do      All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks.   You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home.

            "knowledge": "Heart attack (Lifestyle and home remedies): Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart's health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn't be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.",

            "knowledge": "Heart attack (Treatment): Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you'll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You'll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less \"sticky\" and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart's job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that's passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you've had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you're likely to remain in the hospital for several days.",

Tests to measure lung function You may also be given lung (pulmonary) function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include: - Spirometry. This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out. - Peak flow. A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings. Lung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol, to open your airways. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it's likely you have asthma. Additional tests Other tests to diagnose asthma include: - Methacholine challenge. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger that, when inhaled, will cause mild constriction of your airways. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal. - Nitric oxide test. This test, though not widely available, measures the amount of the gas, nitric oxide, that you have in your breath. When your airways are inflamed - a sign of asthma - you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels. - Imaging tests. A chest X-ray and high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) scan of your lungs and nose cavities (sinuses) can identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems. - Allergy testing. This can be performed by a skin test or blood test. Allergy tests can identify allergy to pets, dust, mold and pollen. If important allergy triggers are identified, this can lead to a recommendation for allergen immunotherapy. - Sputum eosinophils. This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye (eosin). - Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma. In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air. How asthma is classified To classify your asthma severity, your doctor considers your answers to questions about symptoms (such as how often you have asthma attacks and how bad they are), along with the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests. Determining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment. Asthma severity often changes over time, requiring treatment adjustments. Asthma is classified into four general categories:",

Poor lung function is a sign that your asthma isn't well-controlled. In some cases, lung function tests are also used in asthma emergencies to help check the severity of an asthma attack or how well treatment is working. Lung function tests include: - Peak flow. Your doctor may take a peak flow reading when you come in for a scheduled visit or for emergency treatment during an asthma attack. This test measures how quickly you can breathe out. You also may use a peak flow meter at home to monitor your lung function. The results of this test are known as peak expiratory flow (PEF). A peak flow test is done by blowing into a mouthpiece as hard and as fast as you can with a single breath (expiration). - Spirometry. During spirometry, you take deep breaths and forcefully exhale into a hose connected to a machine called a spirometer. A common spirometry measurement is forced expiratory volume, which measures how much air you can breathe out in one second. The results of this test are known as forced expiratory volume (FEV). Spirometry can also measure how much air your lungs can hold and the rate at which you can inhale and exhale. - Nitric oxide measurement. A newer diagnostic test, this exam measures the amount of nitric oxide gas you have in your breath when you exhale. High nitric oxide readings indicate inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Exhaled nitric oxide can be measured by having a patient exhale directly into an analyzer. Exhaled air may be captured in a nitric-oxide-impervious container for measurement later. - Pulse oximetry. This test is used during a severe asthma attack. It measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. It's measured through your fingernail and only takes seconds.",

Trisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 6,000 live births. It is 3 times more common in girls than boys.    The syndrome occurs when there is extra material from chromosome 18. The extra material affects normal development. Symptoms may include:     - Clenched hands   - Crossed legs   - Feet with a rounded bottom (rocker-bottom feet)   - Low birth weight   - Low-set ears   - Mental delay   - Poorly developed fingernails   - Small head (microcephaly)   - Small jaw (micrognathia)   - Undescended testicle   - Unusual shaped chest (pectus carinatum) An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra amniotic fluid. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone.    Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation.   Other signs include:     - Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (coloboma)   - Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (diastasis recti)   - Umbilical hernia or inguinal hernia     There are often signs of congenital heart disease, such as:     - Atrial septal defect (ASD)   - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)   - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)      Tests may also show kidney problems, including:     - Horseshoe kidney   - Hydronephrosis   - Polycystic kidney There are no specific treatments for trisomy 18. Which treatments are used depend on the person's individual condition. Support groups include:     - Support Organization for Trisomy 18, 13 and Related Disorders (SOFT): trisomy.org   - Trisomy 18 Foundation: www.trisomy18.org   - Hope for Trisomy 13 and 18: www.hopefortrisomy13and18.org Half of infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life. Nine out of 10 children will die by 1 year of age. Some children have survived to the teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems. Complications depend on the specific defects and symptoms. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risks of inheriting it, and how to care for the person. Tests can be done during pregnancy to find out if the child has this syndrome.   Genetic testing is recommended for parents who have a child with this syndrome and who want to have more children.

In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Antibiotics can treat gonorrhea. If left untreated, it can cause serious health problems, including problems getting pregnant. Gonorrhea is an STI that is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is an especially serious problem for women because it can damage the female reproductive organs. In 2014, gonorrhea affected more than 162,000 women in the United States.1 Gonorrhea most often affects women ages 15 to 24. But, gonorrhea is becoming more common in older women too.1 Gonorrhea is spread through: Most women with gonorrhea do not have any signs or symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they are often mild and can be mistaken for a bladder or vaginal infection.  Signs or symptoms of gonorrhea depend on where you are first infected by the gonorrhea bacteria.  Signs and symptoms in the genital area can include:  Signs and symptoms in other parts of the body include:  Gonorrhea can cause serious health problems, even if you do not have any signs or symptoms. You also need to get tested if you have any symptoms of gonorrhea.  Testing is very important, because women with untreated gonorrhea can develop serious health problems. If you are tested for gonorrhea, you also need to get tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. There are two ways that a doctor or nurse tests for gonorrhea:  A Pap test is not used to detect gonorrhea. Your doctor or nurse will give you antibiotics to treat gonorrhea. The antibiotics are usually a pill you swallow.  Although antibiotics can cure gonorrhea, they cannot fix any permanent damage done to your body. For this reason, it is important to get tested and to take the antibiotics as soon as possible.  For the antibiotics to work, you must finish all of the antibiotics that your doctor gives you, even if the symptoms go away. Do not share your antibiotics for gonorrhea with anyone. If symptoms do not go away after treatment, see your doctor or nurse. It is possible to get gonorrhea again if you have sex with someone who has gonorrhea. Tell your recent sex partner(s) so they can be tested and treated. Gonorrhea that is not treated can cause serious health problems in women:3 Gonorrhea is easy to treat. But you need to get tested and treated as soon as possible.  If you have gonorrhea: For pregnant women, untreated gonorrhea raises the risk of:  Babies born to infected mothers are at risk for:  Treatment of gonorrhea as soon as it is found in pregnant women will lower the risk of these problems for both mother and baby. Your baby will get antibiotics if you have gonorrhea or if your baby has a gonorrheal eye infection. The best way to prevent gonorrhea or any STI is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex.  If you do have sex, lower your risk of getting an STI with the following steps:  The steps work best when used together. No single step can protect you from every single type of STI. Yes. It is possible to get gonorrhea, or any other STI, if you are a woman who has sex only with women.

Although there is no cure for hemophilia A, current treatments usually work well. Treatment primarily consists of replacing the missing clotting factor VIII ( replacement therapy) and preventing complications that are associated with the disorder. The type and frequency of treatment often depends on the severity of the disorder in each person. People with mild or moderate hemophilia A may be treated with replacement therapy as needed (for example, when a specific bleeding episode occurs). This is called episodic therapy. Some people with mild hemophilia A may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). Desmopressin raises the levels of factor VIII in the blood and may be taken intravenously or through a nasal spray. Drugs known as antifibrinolytics, which slow the breakdown of clotting factors in the blood, can also be used to treat those with a mild form of the disorder. Some people with severe hemophilia A may receive periodic factor VIII infusions to prevent bleeding episodes and associated complications such as joint damage. This is referred to as prophylactic therapy. People can be trained to give infusions at home. This is especially important for people with severe disease because the infusion works the best within one hour of a bleeding episode. In general, rapid treatment is important because it reduces pain and damage to the joints, muscles or other affected tissues or organs .

CHD causes more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects.    Congenital heart disease is often divided into 2 types: cyanotic (blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common congenital heart diseases:   Cyanotic:     - Ebstein's anomaly   - Hypoplastic left heart   - Pulmonary atresia   - Tetralogy of Fallot   - Total anomalous pulmonary venous return   - Transposition of the great vessels   - Tricuspid atresia   - Truncus arteriosus     Non-cyanotic:     - Aortic stenosis   - Atrial septal defect (ASD)   - Atrioventricular canal (endocardial cushion defect)   - Coarctation of the aorta   - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)   - Pulmonic stenosis   - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)      These problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families.    Examples include:      - DiGeorge syndrome   - Down syndrome   - Marfan syndrome   - Noonan syndrome   - Trisomy 13   - Turner syndrome     Often, no cause for the heart disease can be found. Congenital heart diseases continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as rubella) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems.   Poorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to a high rate of congenital heart defects.",

            "knowledge": "critical congenital heart disease (Genetic Changes): In most cases, the cause of CCHD is unknown. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely contribute to this complex condition.   Changes in single genes have been associated with CCHD. Studies suggest that these genes are involved in normal heart development before birth. Most of the identified mutations reduce the amount or function of the protein that is produced from a specific gene, which likely impairs the normal formation of structures in the heart. Studies have also suggested that having more or fewer copies of particular genes compared with other people, a phenomenon known as copy number variation, may play a role in CCHD. However, it is unclear whether genes affected by copy number variation are involved in heart development and how having missing or extra copies of those genes could lead to heart defects. Researchers believe that single-gene mutations and copy number variation account for a relatively small percentage of all CCHD.   CCHD is usually isolated, which means it occurs alone (without signs and symptoms affecting other parts of the body). However, the heart defects associated with CCHD can also occur as part of genetic syndromes that have additional features. Some of these genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, result from changes in the number or structure of particular chromosomes. Other conditions, including Noonan syndrome and Alagille syndrome, result from mutations in single genes.   Environmental factors may also contribute to the development of CCHD. Potential risk factors that have been studied include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs before birth, viral infections (such as rubella and influenza) that occur during pregnancy, and other maternal illnesses including diabetes and phenylketonuria. Although researchers are examining risk factors that may be associated with this complex condition, many of these factors remain unknown.",

Trisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 6,000 live births. It is 3 times more common in girls than boys.    The syndrome occurs when there is extra material from chromosome 18. The extra material affects normal development. Symptoms may include:     - Clenched hands   - Crossed legs   - Feet with a rounded bottom (rocker-bottom feet)   - Low birth weight   - Low-set ears   - Mental delay   - Poorly developed fingernails   - Small head (microcephaly)   - Small jaw (micrognathia)   - Undescended testicle   - Unusual shaped chest (pectus carinatum) An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra amniotic fluid. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone.    Chromosome studies will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called translocation.   Other signs include:     - Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (coloboma)   - Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (diastasis recti)   - Umbilical hernia or inguinal hernia     There are often signs of congenital heart disease, such as:     - Atrial septal defect (ASD)   - Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)   - Ventricular septal defect (VSD)      Tests may also show kidney problems, including:     - Horseshoe kidney   - Hydronephrosis   - Polycystic kidney There are no specific treatments for trisomy 18.

Nine out of 10 children will die by 1 year of age. Some children have survived to the teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems. Complications depend on the specific defects and symptoms. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risks of inheriting it, and how to care for the person.

An epidural block may change or alter labor and delivery.     - If you are very numb from the block, you may have a harder time bearing down to push your baby through the birth canal.   - Contractions may lessen or slow down for a little while, but labor will still move along as it should. In some cases, it may even go faster. If your labor slows down, your doctor can give you medicine to speed up your contractions. It is best to wait until you are in active labor to have the epidural placed.     Other rare side effects are:     - You may get a headache after your epidural but this is rare.   - Medicine could enter your spinal fluid. For a short while, it could make you feel dizzy, or you might have a hard time breathing. You could also have a seizure. This is also rare. There are 2 types:     - \"Walking\" epidural block. This type of epidural will lessen your pain, but you will still be able to move your legs. Most women are not really able to walk around, but they can move their legs.   - Combined spinal epidural block. This combines both a spinal and epidural block. It provides pain relief much faster. The combined block is used when women are in very active labor and want relief right away. Updated by: Laura J.

The key to diagnosis is a detailed history from the affected person, as well as witnesses. Sometimes video- EEG monitoring is necessary. The features that are suggestive of a diagnosis of ADNFLE are: clusters of seizures with a frontal semiology seizures that occur predominantly during sleep normal clinical neurologic exam normal intellect (although reduced intellect, cognitive deficits, or psychiatric disorders may occur) normal findings on neuroimaging ictal EEG (recorded during a seizure) that may be normal or obscured by movement of the cables or electrodes interictal EEG (recorded in between seizures) that shows infrequent epileptiform discharges (distinctive patterns resembling those that occur in people with epilepsy) the presence of the same disorder in other family members, with evidence of autosomal dominant inheritance The diagnosis can be established in a person with the above features, combined with a positive family history and/or genetic testing that detects a mutation in one of the genes known to cause ADNFLE. People who are concerned they may be having seizures or other neurological signs or symptoms should be evaluated by a neurologist .",

            "knowledge": "What is Epilepsy?: The epilepsies are a spectrum of brain disorders ranging from severe, life-threatening and disabling, to ones that are much more benign. In epilepsy, the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed, causing strange sensations, emotions, and behavior or sometimes convulsions, muscle spasms, and loss of consciousness. The epilepsies have many possible causes and there are several types of seizures. Anything that disturbs the normal pattern of neuron activityfrom illness to brain damage to abnormal brain developmentcan lead to seizures. Epilepsy may develop because of an abnormality in brain wiring, an imbalance of nerve signaling chemicals called neurotransmitters, changes in important features of brain cells called channels, or some combination of these and other factors. Having a single seizure as the result of a high fever (called febrile seizure) or head injury does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. Only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. A measurement of electrical activity in the brain and brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography are common diagnostic tests for epilepsy.",

            "knowledge": "Epilepsy (Diagnosis): To diagnose your condition, your doctor will review your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may order several tests to diagnose epilepsy and determine the cause of seizures. Your evaluation may include: - A neurological exam. Your doctor may test your behavior, motor abilities, mental function and other areas to diagnose your condition and determine the type of epilepsy you may have. - Blood tests. Your doctor may take a blood sample to check for signs of infections, genetic conditions or other conditions that may be associated with seizures. Your doctor may also suggest tests to detect brain abnormalities, such as: - Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. In this test, doctors attach electrodes to your scalp with a paste-like substance. The electrodes record the electrical activity of your brain. If you have epilepsy, it's common to have changes in your normal pattern of brain waves, even when you're not having a seizure. Your doctor may monitor you on video while conducting an EEG while you're awake or asleep, to record any seizures you experience. Recording the seizures may help the doctor determine what kind of seizures you're having or rule out other conditions. Your doctor may give you instructions to do something that will cause seizures, such as getting little sleep prior to the test. - High-density EEG. In a variation of an EEG test, your doctor may recommend high-density EEG, which spaces electrodes more closely than conventional EEG - about a half a centimeter apart. High-density EEG may help your doctor more precisely determine which areas of your brain are affected by seizures. - Computerized tomography (CT) scan. A CT scan uses X-rays to obtain cross-sectional images of your brain. CT scans can reveal abnormalities in your brain that might be causing your seizures, such as tumors, bleeding and cysts. - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a detailed view of your brain. Your doctor may be able to detect lesions or abnormalities in your brain that could be causing your seizures. - Functional MRI (fMRI). A functional MRI measures the changes in blood flow that occur when specific parts of your brain are working. Doctors may use an fMRI before surgery to identify the exact locations of critical functions, such as speech and movement, so that surgeons can avoid injuring those places while operating. - Positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans use a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to help visualize active areas of the brain and detect abnormalities. - Single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). This type of test is used primarily if you've had an MRI and EEG that didn't pinpoint the location in your brain where the seizures are originating. A SPECT test uses a small amount of low-dose radioactive material that's injected into a vein to create a detailed, 3-D map of the blood flow activity in your brain during seizures. Doctors also may conduct a form of a SPECT test called subtraction ictal SPECT coregistered to MRI (SISCOM), which may provide even more-detailed results. - Neuropsychological tests. In these tests, doctors assess your thinking, memory and speech skills. The test results help doctors determine which areas of your brain are affected. Along with your test results, your doctor may use a combination of analysis techniques to help pinpoint where in the brain seizures start: - Statistical parametric mapping (SPM). SPM is a method of comparing areas of the brain that have increased metabolism during seizures to normal brains, which can give doctors an idea of where seizures begin. - Curry analysis. Curry analysis is a technique that takes EEG data and projects it onto an MRI of the brain to show doctors where seizures are occurring. - Magnetoencephalography (MEG). MEG measures the magnetic fields produced by brain activity to identify potential areas of seizure onset. Accurate diagnosis of your seizure type and where seizures begin gives you the best chance for finding an effective treatment.",

It is usually taken three or four times a day for arthritis or every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. Nonprescription ibuprofen comes as a tablet, chewable tablet, suspension (liquid), and drops (concentrated liquid). Adults and children older than 12 years of age may usually take nonprescription ibuprofen every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain or fever. Children and infants may usually be given nonprescription ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours as needed for pain or fever, but should not be given more than 4 doses in 24 hours. Ibuprofen may be taken with food or milk to prevent stomach upset. If you are taking ibuprofen on a regular basis, you should take it at the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ibuprofen exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than directed by the package label or prescribed by your doctor.  Ibuprofen comes alone and in combination with other medications. Some of these combination products are available by prescription only, and some of these combination products are available without a prescription and are used to treat cough and cold symptoms and other conditions. If your doctor has prescribed a medication that contains ibuprofen, you should be careful not to take any nonprescription medications that also contain ibuprofen.  If you are selecting a product to treat cough or cold symptoms, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice on which product is best for you. Check nonprescription product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking them together could cause you to receive an overdose. This is especially important if you will be giving cough and cold medications to a child.  Nonprescription cough and cold combination products, including products that contain ibuprofen, can cause serious side effects or death in young children. Do not give these products to children younger than 4 years of age. If you give these products to children 4 to 11 years of age, use caution and follow the package directions carefully.  If you are giving ibuprofen or a combination product that contains ibuprofen to a child, read the package label carefully to be sure that it is the right product for a child of that age. Do not give ibuprofen products that are made for adults to children.  Before you give an ibuprofen product to a child, check the package label to find out how much medication the child should receive. Give the dose that matches the child's age on the chart. Ask the child's doctor if you don't know how much medication to give the child.  Shake the suspension and drops well before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the measuring cup provided to measure each dose of the suspension, and use the dosing device provided to measure each dose of the drops.  The chewable tablets may cause a burning feeling in the mouth or throat. Take the chewable tablets with food or water.  Stop taking nonprescription ibuprofen and call your doctor if your symptoms get worse, you develop new or unexpected symptoms, the part of your body that was painful becomes red or swollen, your pain lasts for more than 10 days, or your fever lasts more than 3 days. Stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child does not start to feel better during the first 24 hours of treatment. Also stop giving nonprescription ibuprofen to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling on the painful part of his body, or if your child's pain or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days.  Do not give nonprescription ibuprofen to a child who has a sore throat that is severe or does not go away, or that comes along with fever, headache, nausea, or vomiting.

There are many ways to quit smoking and many resources to help you, such as:     - Family members, friends, and coworkers may be supportive or encouraging.   - Talk to your doctor about medicines, such as nicotine replacement and prescription medicines.   - If you join smoking cessation programs, you have a much better chance of success. Such programs are offered by hospitals, health departments, community centers, and work sites.      Using nicotine gum around the time of surgery is not encouraged. The nicotine will still interfere with the healing of your surgical wound and have the same effect on your general health as using cigarettes and tobacco. Updated by: Debra G.

Nicotine is an addictive substance.   - Millions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and addiction is still very strong.     Both smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks.",

            "knowledge": "Losing weight after pregnancy: You should plan to return to your pre-pregnancy weight by 6 to 12 months after delivery. Most women lose half of their baby weight by 6 weeks after childbirth (postpartum). The rest most often comes off over the next several months.    A healthy diet with daily exercise will help you shed the pounds. Breastfeeding can also help with postpartum weight loss. Your body needs time to recover from childbirth. If you lose weight too soon after childbirth, it can take longer for you to recover. Give yourself until your 6-week checkup before trying to slim down. If you are breastfeeding, wait until your baby is at least 2 months old and your milk supply has normalized before drastically cutting calories.     - Aim for a weight loss of about a pound and a half a week. You can do this by eating healthy foods and adding in exercise once you are cleared by your health care provider for regular physical activity.   - Women who are exclusively breastfeeding need about 500 more calories per day than they did before pregnancy. Get these calories from healthy choices such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean protein.   - DO NOT drop below the minimum number of calories you need. If you are breastfeeding, you will want to lose weight slowly. Weight loss that happens too fast can make you produce less milk. Losing about a pound and a half (670 grams) a week should not affect your milk supply or your health.    Breastfeeding makes your body burn calories which helps you lose weight. If you are patient, you may be surprised at how much weight you lose naturally while breastfeeding. These healthy eating tips will help you lose weight safely.     - DO NOT skip meals. With a new baby, many new moms forget to eat. If you do not eat, you will have less energy, and it will not help you lose weight.   - Eat 5 to 6 small meals a day with healthy snacks in between (rather than 3 larger meals).   - Eat breakfast. Even if you do not normally eat in the mornings, get into the habit of having breakfast. It will give you energy to start your day and stop you from feeling tired later.   - Slow down. When you take your time eating, you will notice that it is easier to tell that you are full. It is tempting to multitask, but if you focus on your meal you will be less likely to overeat.   - Choose nonfat or low-fat dairy products.    - When you reach for a snack try to include foods with fiber and protein to help keep you full (such as raw bell pepper or carrot with bean dip, apple slices with peanut butter, or a slice of whole-wheat toast with hard-boiled egg). Drink at least 12 cups of fluid a day.    - Keep a water bottle near the spot where you usually feed the baby, that way you'll remember to drink when they do.   - Limit drinks like sodas, juices, and other fluids with added sugar and calories. They can add up and keep you from losing weight.   - Choose broiled or baked rather than fried foods.   - Limit sweets, sugar, saturated fat and trans fats. DO NOT go on a crash diet (not eating enough) or a fad diet (popular diets that limit certain types of foods and nutrients). They will probably make you drop pounds at first, but those first few pounds you lose are fluid and will come back.    Other pounds you lose on a crash diet may be muscle instead of fat. You will gain back any fat you lose on a crash diet once you return to normal eating. You may not be able to return to your exact pre-pregnancy shape. For many women, pregnancy causes lasting changes in the body. You may have a softer belly, wider hips, and a larger waistline. Make your goals about your new body realistic. A healthy diet combined with regular exercise is the best way to shed the pounds. Exercise will help you lose fat instead of muscle.    Once you are ready to start losing weight, eat a little less and move a little more each day. It may be tempting to push yourself into a hard routine for fast weight loss. But rapid weight loss is not healthy and is hard on your body.    DO NOT overdo it. Just a quick walk around the block with your baby in the stroller is a great way to start adding exercise to your daily routine. Updated by: Emily Wax, RD, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, Brooklyn, NY.

            "knowledge": "Diet for rapid weight loss: Rapid weight loss diet is a type of diet in which you lose more than 2 pounds (1 kilogram, kg) a week over several weeks. To lose weight this quickly you eat very few calories. These diets are most often for obese people who need to lose weight quickly because of a health problem. People on these diets should be followed closely by a health care provider. Rapid weight loss is not safe for most people to do on their own.   These diets are only to be used for a short time and are not recommended for more than several weeks. The types of rapid weight loss diets are described below. On a VLCD, you may have as few as 800 calories a day and may lose up to 3 to 5 pounds (1.5 to 2 kg) week. Most VLCDs use meal replacements, such as formulas, soups, shakes, and bars instead of regular meals. This helps ensure that you get all of the nutrients you need each day.    A VLCD is only recommended for adults who are obese and need to lose weight for health reasons. These diets are often used before weight-loss surgery. You should only use a VLCD with the help of your health care provider. Most experts DO NOT recommend using a VLCD for more than 12 weeks. These diets usually allow about 1000 to 1200 calories a day for women and 1200 to 1600 calories a day for men. An LCD is a better choice than a VLCD for most people who want to lose weight quickly. But you should still be supervised by a provider. You will not lose weight as fast with an LCD, but you can lose just as much weight with a VLCD.    An LCD may use a mix of meal replacements and regular food. This makes it easier to follow than a VLCD. Some fad diets also severely limit calories to achieve rapid weight loss. In many cases, these diets are not safe. Once you stop the diet, you are at risk for regaining the weight if you return to your old eating habits. For most people, it is safest to choose a diet in which you lose a 1/2 pound to 2 pounds (225 grams to 1 kg) a week. Rapid weight loss is more about cutting calories than exercising. Talk with your provider about what type of exercise you should do while you are on this type of diet. Your provider may suggest waiting until you are on a more long-term diet to start exercising. Rapid weight loss diet is usually for people who have health problems because of obesity. For these people, losing a lot of weight quickly can help improve:     - Diabetes   - High cholesterol   - High blood pressure You should only follow one of these diets with the help of your provider. Losing more than one 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kg) a week is not safe for most people. It can cause you to lose muscle, water, and bone density. Rapid weight loss can also cause some side effects including:     - Gallstones   - Gout   - Fatigue   - Constipation   - Diarrhea   - Nausea      People who lose weight quickly are also more likely to gain back the weight quickly. This can lead to other health problems.   In general, a rapid weight loss diet is not safe for children. It may also not be safe for teens, pregnant women or older adults unless a provider recommends it.    If you have a health condition, it is a good idea to talk with your provider before starting this or any diet plan to lose weight.

Hormonal therapy is treatment that decreases the effect of testosterone on prostate cancer.   Hormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. The treatment can help relieve symptoms and prevent further growth and spread of cancer. But it does not cure the cancer.   The main type of hormone therapy is called a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormones (LH-RH) agonist:     - The medicine blocks the testicles from making testosterone. The drugs must be given by injection, usually every 3 to 6 months.   - Possible side effects include nausea and vomiting, hot flashes, anemia, fatigue, thinning bones (osteoporosis), reduced sexual desire, decreased muscle mass, weight gain, and impotence.      The other type of hormone medicine is called an androgen-blocking drug:     - It is often given along with LH-RH drugs to block the effect of testosterone produced by the adrenal glands, which make a small amount of testosterone.   - Possible side effects include erection problems, reduced sexual desire, liver problems, diarrhea, and enlarged breasts.      Much of the body's testosterone is made by the testes. As a result, surgery to remove the testes (called orchiectomy) can also be used as a hormonal treatment.",

The goals of treatment include: Lowering the risk of blood clots forming Preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases Reducing risk factors in an effort to slow or stop the buildup of plaque Relieving symptoms Widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries Heart-Healthy Lifestyle Changes Your doctor may recommend heart-healthy lifestyle changes if you have atherosclerosis. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include heart-healthy eating, aiming for a healthy weight, managing stress, physical activity and quitting smoking. Medicines Sometimes lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough to control your cholesterol levels. For example, you also may need statin medications to control or lower your cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having a heart attack or stroke. Doctors usually prescribe statins for people who have: Coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, or had a prior stroke Diabetes High LDL cholesterol levels Doctors may discuss beginning statin treatment with people who have an elevated risk for developing heart disease or having a stroke. Your doctor also may prescribe other medications to: Lower your blood pressure Lower your blood sugar levels Prevent blood clots, which can lead to heart attack and stroke Prevent inflammation Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don’t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to. You should still follow a heart healthy lifestyle, even if you take medicines to treat your atherosclerosis. Medical Procedures and Surgery If you have severe atherosclerosis, your doctor may recommend a medical procedure or surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as coronary angioplasty, is a procedure that’s used to open blocked or narrowed coronary (heart) arteries. PCI can improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Sometimes a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the artery to keep it open after the procedure. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery. In CABG, arteries or veins from other areas in your body are used to bypass or go around your narrowed coronary arteries. CABG can improve blood flow to your heart, relieve chest pain, and possibly prevent a heart attack. Bypass grafting also can be used for leg arteries. For this surgery, a healthy blood vessel is used to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery in one of the legs. The healthy blood vessel redirects blood around the blocked artery, improving blood flow to the leg. Carotid endarterectomy is a type of surgery to remove plaque buildup from the carotid arteries in the neck. This procedure restores blood flow to the brain, which can help prevent a stroke.",

Your risk for atherosclerosis increases with the number of risk factors you have. One step you can take is to adopt a healthy lifestyle, which can include: Heart-Healthy Eating. Adopt heart-healthy eating habits, which include eating different fruits and vegetables (including beans and peas), whole grains, lean meats, poultry without skin, seafood, and fat-free or low-fat milk and dairy products. A heart-healthy diet is low in sodium, added sugar, solid fats, and refined grains. Following a heart-healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Physical Activity. Be as physically active as you can. Physical activity can improve your fitness level and your health. Ask your doctor what types and amounts of activity are safe for you. Read more about Physical Activity and Your Heart. Quit Smoking. If you smoke, quit. Smoking can damage and tighten blood vessels and raise your risk for atherosclerosis. Talk with your doctor about programs and products that can help you quit. Also, try to avoid secondhand smoke. Read more about Smoking and Your Heart. Weight Control. If you’re overweight or obese, work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. Controlling your weight helps you control risk factors for atherosclerosis. Other steps that can prevent or delay atherosclerosis include knowing your family history of atherosclerosis. If you or someone in your family has an atherosclerosis-related disease, be sure to tell your doctor. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, your doctor may prescribe medicines to control your atherosclerosis risk factors. Take all of your medicines as your doctor advises.  ",

            "knowledge": "What is Atherosclerosis?: Espaol  Atherosclerosis is a disease in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to your heart and other parts of your body.  Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your organs and other parts of your body.  Atherosclerosis can lead to serious problems, including heart attack, stroke, or even death.  Atherosclerosis    Atherosclerosis-Related Diseases  Atherosclerosis can affect any artery in the body, including arteries in the heart, brain, arms, legs, pelvis, and kidneys. As a result, different diseases may develop based on which arteries are affected.  Coronary Heart Disease  Coronary heart disease (CHD), also called coronary artery disease, occurs when plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.  Plaque narrows the coronary arteries and reduces blood flow to your heart muscle. Plaque buildup also makes it more likely that blood clots will form in your arteries. Blood clots can partially or completely block blood flow.  If blood flow to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, you may have angina (chest pain or discomfort) or a heart attack.  Plaque also can form in the heart's smallest arteries. This disease is called coronary microvascular disease (MVD). In coronary MVD, plaque doesn't cause blockages in the arteries as it does in CHD.  Carotid Artery Disease  Carotid (ka-ROT-id) artery disease occurs if plaque builds up in the arteries on each side of your neck (the carotid arteries). These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your brain. If blood flow to your brain is reduced or blocked, you may have a stroke.  Peripheral Artery Disease  Peripheral artery disease (P.A.D.) occurs if plaque builds up in the major arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your legs, arms, and pelvis.  If blood flow to these parts of your body is reduced or blocked, you may have numbness, pain, and, sometimes, dangerous infections.  Chronic Kidney Disease  Chronic kidney disease can occur if plaque builds up in the renal arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your kidneys.  Over time, chronic kidney disease causes a slow loss of kidney function. The main function of the kidneys is to remove waste and extra water from the body.  Overview  The cause of atherosclerosis isn't known. However, certain traits, conditions, or habits may raise your risk for the disease. These conditions are known as risk factors.  You can control some risk factors, such as lack of physical activity, smoking, and an unhealthy diet. Others you can't control, such as age and a family history of heart disease.  Some people who have atherosclerosis have no signs or symptoms. They may not be diagnosed until after a heart attack or stroke.  The main treatment for atherosclerosis is lifestyle changes. You also may need medicines and medical procedures. These treatments, along with ongoing medical care, can help you live a healthier life.  Outlook  Improved treatments have reduced the number of deaths from atherosclerosis-related diseases. These treatments also have improved the quality of life for people who have these diseases. However, atherosclerosis remains a common health problem.  You may be able to prevent or delay atherosclerosis and the diseases it can cause. Making lifestyle changes and getting ongoing care can help you avoid the problems of atherosclerosis and live a long, healthy life.",

Conjunctivitis may occur in a newborn child. Swollen or inflamed eyes are most commonly caused by:     - A blocked tear duct   - Eye drops with antibiotics, given right after birth   - Infection by bacteria or viruses      Bacteria that normally live in a woman's vagina may be passed to the baby during childbirth. More serious eye damage may be caused by:      - Gonorrhea and chlamydia: These are infections spread from sexual contact.   - The viruses that cause genital and oral herpes: These may lead to severe eye damage. Herpes eye infections are less common than those caused by gonorrhea and chlamydia.      The mother may not have symptoms at the time of delivery. She still may carry bacteria or viruses that can cause this problem. Infected newborn infants develop drainage from the eyes within 1 day to 2 weeks after birth.   The eyelids become puffy, red, and tender.   There may be watery, bloody, or thick pus-like drainage from the infant's eyes. The health care provider will perform an eye exam on the baby. If the eye does not appear normal, the following tests may be done:     - Culture of the drainage from the eye to look for bacteria or viruses   - Slit-lamp exam to look for damage to the surface of the eyeball Eye swelling that is caused by the eye drops given at birth should go away on its own.   For a blocked tear duct, gentle warm massage between the eye and nasal area may help. This is most often tried before starting antibiotics. Surgery may be needed if a blocked tear duct has not cleared up by the time the baby is 1 year old.    Antibiotics are often needed for eye infections caused by bacteria. Eye drops and ointments may also be used. Salt water eye drops may be used to remove sticky yellow drainage.   Special antiviral eye drops or ointments are used for herpes infections of the eye. Quick diagnosis and treatment usually leads to good outcomes. Complications may include:     - Blindness   - Inflammation of the iris   - Scar or hole in the cornea -- the clear structure that is over the colored part of the eye (the iris) Talk to your provider if you have given birth (or expect to give birth) in a place where antibiotic or silver nitrate drops are not routinely placed in the infant's eyes. An example would be having an unsupervised birth at home. This is very important if you have or are at risk for any sexually transmitted disease.

The following actions can also help prevent hypoglycemia:Knowing your blood glucose level can help you decide how much medicine to take, what food to eat, and how physically active to be. To find out your blood glucose level, check yourself with a blood glucose meter as often as your doctor advises.Hypoglycemia unawareness. Sometimes people with diabetes don’t feel or recognize the symptoms of hypoglycemia, a problem called hypoglycemia unawareness. If you have had hypoglycemia without feeling any symptoms, you may need to check your blood glucose more often so you know when you need to treat your hypoglycemia or take steps to prevent it. Be sure to check your blood glucose before you drive.If you have hypoglycemia unawareness or have hypoglycemia often, ask your health care provider about a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM checks your blood glucose level at regular times throughout the day and night. CGMs can tell you if your blood glucose is falling quickly and sound an alarm if your blood glucose falls too low. CGM alarms can wake you up if you have hypoglycemia during sleep.Your meal plan is key to preventing hypoglycemia. Eat regular meals and snacks with the correct amount of carbohydrates to help keep your blood glucose level from going too low. Also, if you drink alcoholic beverages, it’s best to eat some food at the same time.Physical activity can lower your blood glucose during the activity and for hours afterward. To help prevent hypoglycemia, you may need to check your blood glucose before, during, and after physical activity and adjust your medicine or carbohydrate intake. For example, you might eat a snack before being physically active or decrease your insulin dose as directed by your health care provider to keep your blood glucose from dropping too low.Tell your health care team if you have had hypoglycemia.

If medications are stopped or taken infrequently, the symptoms are likely to come back and your doctor will have a hard time knowing what the best and safest dose is. - Check first before taking other medications. Contact the doctor who's treating your child for schizophrenia before your child takes medications prescribed by another doctor or before taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, minerals, herbs or other supplements. These can interact with schizophrenia medications. - Pay attention to warning signs. You and your child may have identified things that may trigger symptoms, cause a relapse or prevent your child from carrying out daily activities. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your child's doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms, to prevent the situation from worsening. - Make physical activity and healthy eating a priority. Some medications for schizophrenia are associated with an increased risk of weight gain and high cholesterol in children. Work with your child's doctor to make a nutrition and physical activity plan for your child that will help manage weight and benefit heart health. - Avoid alcohol, street drugs and tobacco. Alcohol, street drugs and tobacco can worsen schizophrenia symptoms or interfere with antipsychotic medications. Talk to your child about avoiding drugs and alcohol and not smoking. If necessary, get appropriate treatment for a substance use problem.",

            "knowledge": "Heart attack (Lifestyle and home remedies): Your lifestyle affects your heart health. The following steps can help you not only prevent but also recover from a heart attack: - Avoid smoke. The most important thing you can do to improve your heart's health is to not smoke. Also, avoid being around secondhand smoke. If you need to quit, ask your doctor for help. - Control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If one or both of these is high, your doctor can prescribe changes to your diet and medications. Ask your doctor how often you need to have your blood pressure and cholesterol levels monitored. - Get regular medical checkups. Some of the major risk factors for heart attack - high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes - cause no symptoms early on. Your doctor can perform tests to check for these conditions and help you manage them, if necessary. - Exercise regularly. Regular exercise helps improve heart muscle function after a heart attack and helps prevent a heart attack by helping you to control your weight, diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure. Exercise needn't be vigorous. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can improve your health. - Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight strains your heart and can contribute to high cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes. - Eat a heart-healthy diet. Saturated fat, trans fats and cholesterol in your diet can narrow arteries to your heart, and too much salt can raise blood pressure. Eat a heart-healthy diet that includes lean proteins, such as fish and beans, plenty of fruits and vegetables and whole grains. - Manage diabetes. High blood sugar is damaging to your heart. Regular exercise, eating well and losing weight all help to keep blood sugar levels at more-desirable levels. Many people also need medication to manage their diabetes. - Control stress. Reduce stress in your day-to-day activities. Rethink workaholic habits and find healthy ways to minimize or deal with stressful events in your life. - If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger.",

Medicines and fluids pass through this IV.   - You may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain.   - You may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you. In that case, you will be given another medicine that prevents blood clots.   - Dangerous abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) may be treated with medicine or electric shocks.       EMERGENCY PROCEDURES    Angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart.      - Angioplasty is often the first choice of treatment. It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack.   - A stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again.      You may be given drugs to break up the clot. This is called thrombolytic therapy. It is best if these drugs are given soon after the onset of symptoms, usually no later than 12 hours after it and ideally within 30 minutes of arriving to the hospital.   Some people may also have heart bypass surgery to open narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting and/or open heart surgery.    TREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK    After several days, you will be discharged from the hospital.   You will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life. Always talk to your provider before stopping or changing how you take any medicines. Stopping certain medicines can be deadly.    While under the care of your health care team, you will learn:     - How to take medicines to treat your heart problem and prevent more heart attacks   - How to eat a heart-healthy diet   - How to be active and exercise safely   - What to do when you have chest pain   - How to stop smoking      Strong emotions are common after a heart attack.     - You may feel sad   - You may feel anxious and worry about being careful about everything you do      All of these feelings are normal. They go away for most people after 2 or 3 weeks.   You may also feel tired when you leave the hospital to go home.   Most people who have had a heart attack take part in a cardiac rehabilitation program.",

            "knowledge": "Heart attack (Treatment): Heart attack treatment at a hospital With each passing minute after a heart attack, more heart tissue loses oxygen and deteriorates or dies. The main way to prevent heart damage is to restore blood flow quickly. Medications Medications given to treat a heart attack include: - Aspirin. The 911 operator may instruct you to take aspirin, or emergency medical personnel may give you aspirin immediately. Aspirin reduces blood clotting, thus helping maintain blood flow through a narrowed artery. - Thrombolytics. These drugs, also called clotbusters, help dissolve a blood clot that's blocking blood flow to your heart. The earlier you receive a thrombolytic drug after a heart attack, the greater the chance you'll survive and with less heart damage. - Antiplatelet agents. Emergency room doctors may give you other drugs to help prevent new clots and keep existing clots from getting larger. These include medications, such as clopidogrel (Plavix) and others, called platelet aggregation inhibitors. - Other blood-thinning medications. You'll likely be given other medications, such as heparin, to make your blood less \"sticky\" and less likely to form clots. Heparin is given intravenously or by an injection under your skin. - Pain relievers. You may receive a pain reliever, such as morphine, to ease your discomfort. - Nitroglycerin. This medication, used to treat chest pain (angina), can help improve blood flow to the heart by widening (dilating) the blood vessels. - Beta blockers. These medications help relax your heart muscle, slow your heartbeat and decrease blood pressure, making your heart's job easier. Beta blockers can limit the amount of heart muscle damage and prevent future heart attacks. - ACE inhibitors. These drugs lower blood pressure and reduce stress on the heart. Surgical and other procedures In addition to medications, you may undergo one of the following procedures to treat your heart attack: - Coronary angioplasty and stenting. Doctors insert a long, thin tube (catheter) that's passed through an artery, usually in your leg or groin, to a blocked artery in your heart. If you've had a heart attack, this procedure is often done immediately after a cardiac catheterization, a procedure used to locate blockages. This catheter is equipped with a special balloon that, once in position, is briefly inflated to open a blocked coronary artery. A metal mesh stent may be inserted into the artery to keep it open long term, restoring blood flow to the heart. Depending on your condition, your doctor may opt to place a stent coated with a slow-releasing medication to help keep your artery open. - Coronary artery bypass surgery. In some cases, doctors may perform emergency bypass surgery at the time of a heart attack. If possible, your doctor may suggest that you have bypass surgery after your heart has had time - about three to seven days - to recover from your heart attack. Bypass surgery involves sewing veins or arteries in place beyond a blocked or narrowed coronary artery, allowing blood flow to the heart to bypass the narrowed section. Once blood flow to your heart is restored and your condition is stable, you're likely to remain in the hospital for several days.",

            "knowledge": "Autoimmune disorders: An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 types of autoimmune disorders. The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces antibodies against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.   When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and antigens. As a result, the body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.    The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.   An autoimmune disorder may result in:     - The destruction of body tissue   - Abnormal growth of an organ   - Changes in organ function      An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:     - Blood vessels   - Connective tissues   - Endocrine glands such as the thyroid or pancreas   - Joints   - Muscles   - Red blood cells   - Skin      A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include:     - Addison disease   - Celiac disease - sprue (gluten-sensitive enteropathy)   - Dermatomyositis   - Graves disease   - Hashimoto thyroiditis   - Multiple sclerosis   - Myasthenia gravis   - Pernicious anemia   - Reactive arthritis   - Rheumatoid arthritis   - Sjögren syndrome   - Systemic lupus erythematosus   - Type I diabetes Symptoms will vary based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include:     - Fatigue   - Fever   - General ill-feeling (malaise)   - Joint pain   - Rash The health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease.   Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include:     - Antinuclear antibody tests   - Autoantibody tests   - CBC   - Comprehensive metabolic panel   - C-reactive protein (CRP)   - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)   - Urinalysis The goals of treatment are to:     - Reduce symptoms   - Control the autoimmune process   - Maintain the body's ability to fight disease      Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include:     - Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease   - Blood transfusions if blood is affected   - Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected      Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are often called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs called tumor necrosis factor (TFN) blockers can be used for some diseases. The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are chronic, but many can be controlled with treatment.   Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up. Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk of infections. Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder. There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders. Updated by: Laura J.

            "knowledge": "Pancreatic pseudocyst: A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled sac in the abdomen. It may also contain tissue from the pancreas, enzymes, and blood. The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon.   Pancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of sudden, severe pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is sudden swelling of the pancreas. There are many causes of this problem.   This problem may sometimes occur:      - In someone with chronic swelling of the pancreas   - After trauma to the belly, more often in children     The cyst happens when the ducts (tubes) in the pancreas are damaged and fluid with enzymes cannot drain. Symptoms can occur within days to months after an attack of pancreatitis, and include:     - Bloating of the abdomen   - Constant pain or deep ache in the abdomen, which may also be felt in the back    - Difficulty eating and digesting food The health care provider may feel your abdomen for a pseudocyst. It will feel like a lump in the middle or left upper abdomen.   Tests that may help diagnose pancreatic pseudocyst include:     - Abdominal CT scan   - Abdominal MRI   - Abdominal ultrasound   - Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) Treatment depends on the size of the pseudocyst and whether it is causing symptoms. Many pseudocysts go away on their own. Those that remain for more than 6 weeks and are larger than 5 cm in diameter often need treatment.   Possible treatments include:     - Drainage through the skin using a needle, most often guided by a CT scan   - Endoscopic-assisted drainage using an endoscope (a tube containing a camera and a light that is passed down into the stomach)   - Surgical drainage of the pseudocyst, which involves making a connection between the cyst and the stomach or small intestine. This may be done using a laparoscope. The outcome is generally good with treatment. It is important to make sure that it is not a pancreatic cancer that starts in a cyst, which has a worse outcome. Complications may include:     - A pancreatic abscess can develop if the pseudocyst becomes infected.   - The pseudocyst can break open (rupture), which can be a serious complication because shock and excess bleeding (hemorrhage) may develop.   - The pseudocyst may press down on (compress) nearby organs. Rupture of the pseudocyst is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you develop symptoms of bleeding or shock, such as:     - Fainting   - Fever and chills   - Rapid heartbeat   - Severe abdominal pain The way to prevent pancreatic pseudocysts is by preventing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is caused by gallstones, it is often necessary to remove the gallbladder with surgery (cholecystectomy).    When pancreatitis occurs due to alcohol abuse, you must stop drinking alcohol to prevent future attacks.   When pancreatitis occurs due to high blood triglycerides, this condition should be treated.

Insulin helps cells throughout the body absorb glucose from the bloodstream and use it for energy.Diabetes develops when the pancreas does not make enough insulin, the body's cells do not use insulin effectively, or both. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells in the body.In type 1 diabetes, the beta cells of the pancreas no longer make insulin because the body's immune system has attacked and destroyed them. The immune system protects people from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. A person who has type 1 diabetes must take insulin daily to live. Type 2 diabetes usually begins with a condition called insulin resistance, in which the body has trouble using insulin effectively.

Purging may include using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include spending a large amount of time exercising, suddenly eating large amounts of food, regularly going to the bathroom after meals, or throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics."

Although there's no way to repair the sex chromosome changes due to Klinefelter syndrome, treatments can help minimize its effects. The earlier a diagnosis is made and treatment is started, the greater the benefits. But it's never too late to get help. Treatment for Klinefelter syndrome may include: - Testosterone replacement therapy. Starting at the time of the usual onset of puberty, testosterone replacement can be given to help stimulate changes that normally occur at puberty, such as developing a deeper voice, growing facial and body hair, and increasing muscle mass and penis size. Testosterone therapy can also improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. It will not result in testicle enlargement or improve infertility. - Breast tissue removal. In males who develop enlarged breasts, excess breast tissue can be removed by a plastic surgeon, leaving a more normal-looking chest. - Speech and physical therapy. These treatments can help boys with Klinefelter syndrome overcome problems with speech, language and muscle weakness. - Educational evaluation and support. Some boys with Klinefelter syndrome have trouble learning and socializing and can benefit from extra assistance. Talk to your child's teacher, school counselor or school nurse about what kind of support might help. - Fertility treatment. Most men with Klinefelter syndrome are unable to father children because few or no sperm are produced in the testicles. For some men with minimal sperm production, a procedure called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) may help. During ICSI, sperm is removed from the testicle with a biopsy needle and injected directly into the egg. - Psychological counseling. Having Klinefelter syndrome can be a challenge, especially during puberty and young adulthood. For men with the condition, coping with infertility can be difficult. A family therapist, counselor or psychologist can help work through the emotional issues.",

Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain, and more and more evidence points to sugary drinks, including fruit juices, as culprits in obesity in some people.   - Lack of exercise. Children who don't exercise much are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn as many calories. Too much time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching television or playing video games, also contributes to the problem.   - Family factors. If your child comes from a family of overweight people, he or she may be more likely to put on weight. This is especially true in an environment where high-calorie foods are always available and physical activity isn't encouraged.   - Psychological factors. Personal, parental and family stress can increase a child's risk of obesity. Some children overeat to cope with problems or to deal with emotions, such as stress, or to fight boredom. Their parents may have similar tendencies.   - Socioeconomic factors. People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. As a result, they may opt for convenience foods that don't spoil quickly, such as frozen meals, crackers and cookies. In addition, people who live in lower income neighborhoods might not have access to a safe place to exercise.",

Some risk factors can be changed, such as unhealthy lifestyle habits and environments. Other risk factors, such as age, family history and genetics, race and ethnicity, and sex, cannot be changed. Heathy lifestyle changes can decrease your risk for developing overweight and obesity. Unhealthy lifestyle habits Lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating patterns, not enough sleep, and high amounts of stress can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Lack of physical activity Lack of physical activity due to high amounts of TV, computer, videogame or other screen usage has been associated with a high body mass index. Healthy lifestyle changes, such as being physically active and reducing screen time, can help you aim for a healthy weight. Unhealthy eating behaviors Some unhealthy eating behaviors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity. Eating more calories than you use. The amount of calories you need will vary based on your sex, age, and physical activity level. Find out your daily calorie needs or goals with the Body Weight Planner. Eating too much saturated and trans fats Eating foods high in added sugars Visit Heart-healthy eating for more information about healthy eating patterns. Not enough sleep Many studies have seen a high BMI in people who do not get enough sleep. Some studies have seen a relationship between sleep and the way our bodies use nutrients for energy and how lack of sleep can affect hormones that control hunger urges. Visit our Sleep Deprivation and Deficiency Health Topic for more information about lack of sleep. High amounts of stress Acute stress and chronic stress affect the brain and trigger the production of hormones, such as cortisol, that control our energy balances and hunger urges. Acute stress can trigger hormone changes that make you not want to eat. If the stress becomes chronic, hormone changes can make you eat more and store more fat. Age Childhood obesity remains a serious problem in the United States, and some populations are more at risk for childhood obesity than others. The risk of unhealthy weight gain increases as you age. Adults who have a healthy BMI often start to gain weight in young adulthood and continue to gain weight until 60 to 65 years old, when they tend to start losing weight. Unhealthy environments Many environmental factors can increase your risk for overweight and obesity:   social factors such as having a low socioeconomic status or an unhealthy social or unsafe environment in the neighborhood  built environment factors such as easy access to unhealthy fast foods, limited access to recreational facilities or parks, and few safe or easy ways to walk in your neighborhood exposure to chemicals known as obesogens that can change hormones and increase fatty tissue in our bodies Family history and genetics Genetic studies have found that overweight and obesity can run in families, so it is possible that our genes or DNA can cause these conditions. Research studies have found that certain DNA elements are associated with obesity. Read more Did you know obesity can change your DNA and the DNA you pass on to your children? Learn more about these DNA changes. Eating too much or eating too little during your pregnancy can change your baby’s DNA and can affect how your child stores and uses fat later in life. Also, studies have shown that obese fathers have DNA changes in their sperm that can be passed on to their children. Race or ethnicity Overweight and obesity is highly prevalent in some racial and ethnic minority groups. Rates of obesity in American adults are highest in blacks, followed by Hispanics, then whites. This is true for men or women. While Asian men and women have the lowest rates of unhealthy BMIs, they may have high amounts of unhealthy fat in the abdomen. Samoans may be at risk for overweight and obesity because they may carry a DNA variant that is associated with increased BMI but not with common obesity-related complications. Sex In the United States, obesity is more common in black or Hispanic women than in black or Hispanic men. A person’s sex may also affect the way the body stores fat. For example, women tend to store less unhealthy fat in the abdomen than men do. Overweight and obesity is also common in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This is an endocrine condition that causes large ovaries and prevents proper ovulation, which can reduce fertility.    ",

Obesity can be caused by:  - Eating more food than your body can use  - Drinking too much alcohol  - Not getting enough exercise    Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.  Today, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods become obese, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally.   The way we eat when we are children can affect the way we eat as adults.   The way we eat over many years becomes a habit. It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.   We may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.   - Many people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.  - More people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.  - People with little free time may have less time to exercise.    The term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image. A person may be obese, follow an unhealthy diet, and have an eating disorder all at the same time.  Sometimes, medical problems or treatments cause weight gain, including:  - Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)  - Medicines such as birth control pills, antidepressants, and antipsychotics    Other things that can cause weight gain are:  - Quitting smoking. Many people who quit smoking gain 4 to 10 pounds in the first 6 months after quitting.  - Stress, anxiety, feeling sad, or not sleeping well  - Menopause. Women may gain 12 to 15 pounds during menopause.  - Pregnancy. Women may not lose the weight they gained during pregnancy.",

            "knowledge": "Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension   - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension   - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins   - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease)   - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease   - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema   - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium)   - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders   - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders   - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis   - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease   - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension.",

            "knowledge": "Tooth abscess: A tooth abscess is a buildup of infected material (pus) in the center of a tooth. It is an infection caused by bacteria. A tooth abscess may form if there is tooth decay. It may also occur when a tooth is broken, chipped, or injured in other ways. Openings in the tooth enamel allow bacteria to infect the center of the tooth (the pulp). Infection may spread from the root of the tooth to the bones supporting the tooth.   Infection results in a buildup of pus and tissue swelling within the tooth. This causes a toothache. The toothache may stop if pressure is relieved. But the infection can remain active and continue to spread. This can cause more pain and can destroy tissue. The main symptom is a severe toothache. The pain is continuous. It does not stop. It can be described as gnawing, sharp, shooting, or throbbing.   Other symptoms may include:      - Bitter taste in the mouth   - Breath odor   - General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling   - Fever   - Pain when chewing   - Sensitivity of the teeth to hot or cold   - Swelling of the gum over the infected tooth, which may look like a pimple   - Swollen glands of the neck   - Swollen area of the upper or lower jaw, which is a very serious symptom Your dentist will closely look at your teeth, mouth, and gums. It may hurt when the dentist taps the tooth. Biting or closing your mouth tightly also increases the pain. Your gums may be swollen and red, and may drain thick material.   Dental x-rays and other tests can help your dentist determine which tooth or teeth are causing the problem. The goals of treatment are to cure the infection, save the tooth, and prevent complications.   Your dentist might prescribe antibiotics to fight the infection. Warm saltwater rinses may help ease the pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers may relieve your toothache and fever.   Do NOT place aspirin directly on your tooth or gums. This increases irritation of the tissues and can result in mouth ulcers.   A root canal may be recommended in an attempt to save the tooth.   If you have a severe infection, your tooth may be removed, or you may need surgery to drain the abscess. Some people may need to be admitted to the hospital. Untreated abscesses may get worse and can lead to life-threatening complications.   Prompt treatment cures the infection in most cases. The tooth can often be saved. These complications can occur:     - Loss of the tooth   - Blood infection   - Spread of infection to soft tissue   - Spread of infection to the jaw bone   - Spread of infection to other areas of the body, which can cause brain abscess, inflammation in the heart, pneumonia, or other complications Call your dentist if you have a throbbing toothache that does not go away, or if you notice a bubble (or “pimple”) on your gums. Prompt treatment of dental decay reduces the risk of tooth abscess. Have your dentist examine any broken or chipped teeth right away.

It's clear, however, that certain factors increase the risk, including: - Weight. Being overweight is a primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your cells become to insulin. However, you don't have to be overweight to develop type 2 diabetes.   - Fat distribution. If your body stores fat primarily in your abdomen, your risk of type 2 diabetes is greater than if your body stores fat elsewhere, such as your hips and thighs.   - Inactivity. The less active you are, the greater your risk of type 2 diabetes. Physical activity helps you control your weight, uses up glucose as energy and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.   - Family history. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases if your parent or sibling has type 2 diabetes.   - Race. Although it's unclear why, people of certain races - including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians and Asian-Americans - are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than whites are.   - Age. The risk of type 2 diabetes increases as you get older, especially after age 45. That's probably because people tend to exercise less, lose muscle mass and gain weight as they age. But type 2 diabetes is also increasing dramatically among children, adolescents and younger adults.   - Prediabetes. Prediabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar level is higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Left untreated, prediabetes often progresses to type 2 diabetes.   - Gestational diabetes. If you developed gestational diabetes when you were pregnant, your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases. If you gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms), you're also at risk of type 2 diabetes.   - Polycystic ovarian syndrome. For women, having polycystic ovarian syndrome - a common condition characterized by irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity - increases the risk of diabetes.",

            "knowledge": "Cystic fibrosis (Symptoms): Screening of newborns for cystic fibrosis is now performed in every state in the United States. As a result, the condition can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. For people born before newborn screening was performed, it's important to be aware of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until adolescence or adulthood. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis affect the respiratory system and digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as: - A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)   - Wheezing   - Breathlessness   - Exercise intolerance   - Repeated lung infections   - Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat. The result is often: - Foul-smelling, greasy stools   - Poor weight gain and growth   - Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus)   - Severe constipation Frequent straining while passing stool can cause part of the rectum - the end of the large intestine - to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse). When this occurs in children, it may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. Parents should consult a physician knowledgeable about cystic fibrosis. Rectal prolapse in children may sometimes require surgery. Rectal prolapse in children with cystic fibrosis is less common than it was in the past, which may be due to earlier testing, diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis. If you or your child has symptoms of cystic fibrosis - or if someone in your family has cystic fibrosis - talk with your doctor about testing for the disease. Seek immediate medical care if you or your child has difficulty breathing.",

            "knowledge": "What are the symptoms of Prostate Cancer?: Symptoms Most cancers in their early, most treatable stages don't cause any symptoms. Early prostate cancer usually does not cause symptoms. However, if prostate cancer develops and is not treated, it can cause these symptoms: - a need to urinate frequently, especially at night  - difficulty starting urination or holding back urine  - inability to urinate  - weak or interrupted flow of urine  - painful or burning urination  - difficulty in having an erection  - painful ejaculation  - blood in urine or semen  - pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. a need to urinate frequently, especially at night difficulty starting urination or holding back urine inability to urinate weak or interrupted flow of urine painful or burning urination difficulty in having an erection painful ejaculation blood in urine or semen pain or stiffness in the lower back, hips, or upper thighs. Any of these symptoms may be caused by cancer, but more often they are due to enlargement of the prostate, which is not cancer. If You Have Symptoms If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor or a urologist to find out if you need treatment. A urologist is a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the genitourinary system. The doctor will ask questions about your medical history and perform an exam to try to find the cause of the prostate problems. The PSA Test The doctor may also suggest a blood test to check your prostate specific antigen, or PSA, level. PSA levels can be high not only in men who have prostate cancer, but also in men with an enlarged prostate gland and men with infections of the prostate. PSA tests may be very useful for early cancer diagnosis. However, PSA tests alone do not always tell whether or not cancer is present. PSA screening for prostate cancer is not perfect. (Screening tests check for disease in a person who shows no symptoms.) Most men with mildly elevated PSA do not have prostate cancer, and many men with prostate cancer have normal levels of PSA. A recent study revealed that men with low prostate specific antigen levels, or PSA, may still have prostate cancer. Also, the digital rectal exam can miss many prostate cancers. Other Tests The doctor may order other exams, including ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans, to learn more about the cause of the symptoms. But to confirm the presence of cancer, doctors must perform a biopsy. During a biopsy, the doctor uses needles to remove small tissue samples from the prostate and then looks at the samples under a microscope. If Cancer is Present If a biopsy shows that cancer is present, the doctor will report on the grade of the tumor. Doctors describe a tumor as low, medium, or high-grade cancer, based on the way it appears under the microscope. One way of grading prostate cancer, called the Gleason system, uses scores of 2 to 10. Another system uses G1 through G4. The higher the score, the higher the grade of the tumor. High-grade tumors grow more quickly and are more likely to spread than low-grade tumors.",

            "knowledge": "ataxia with vitamin E deficiency: Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is a disorder that impairs the body's ability to use vitamin E obtained from the diet. Vitamin E is an antioxidant, which means that it protects cells in the body from the damaging effects of unstable molecules called free radicals. A shortage (deficiency) of vitamin E can lead to neurological problems, such as difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and speech (dysarthria), loss of reflexes in the legs (lower limb areflexia), and a loss of sensation in the extremities (peripheral neuropathy). Some people with this condition have developed an eye disorder called retinitis pigmentosa that causes vision loss. Most people who have ataxia with vitamin E deficiency start to experience problems with movement between the ages of 5 and 15 years. The movement problems tend to worsen with age. Ataxia with vitamin E deficiency is a rare condition; however, its prevalence is unknown. Mutations in the TTPA gene cause ataxia with vitamin E deficiency. The TTPA gene provides instructions for making the α-tocopherol transfer protein (αTTP), which is found in the liver and brain. This protein controls distribution of vitamin E obtained from the diet (also called α-tocopherol) to cells and tissues throughout the body. Vitamin E helps cells prevent damage that might be done by free radicals.   TTPA gene mutations impair the activity of the αTTP protein, resulting in an inability to retain and use dietary vitamin E. As a result, vitamin E levels in the blood are greatly reduced and free radicals accumulate within cells. Nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system) are particularly vulnerable to the damaging effects of free radicals and these cells die off when they are deprived of vitamin E. Nerve cell damage can lead to problems with movement and other features of ataxia with vitamin E deficiency. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.

            "knowledge": "Headache (Causes): The most common type of headache is tension headache. It is likely caused by tight muscles in your shoulders, neck, scalp, and jaw. A tension headache:      - May be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position.   - Tends to be on both sides of your head. It often starts at the back of the head and spreads forward. The pain may feel dull or squeezing, like a tight band or vice. Your shoulders, neck, or jaw may feel tight or sore.      A migraine headache involves severe pain. It usually occurs with other symptoms, such as vision changes, sensitivity to sound or light, or nausea. With a migraine:      - The pain may be throbbing, pounding, or pulsating. It tends to begin on one side of your head. It may spread to both sides.   - The headache may be associated with an aura. This is a group of warning symptoms that start before your headache. The pain usually gets worse as you try to move around.   - Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers.      Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. For this reason, these headaches are also called medicine overuse headaches. People who take pain medicine more than 3 days a week on a regular basis can develop this type of headache.   Other types of headaches:     - Cluster headache is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. The headache usually lasts less than an hour. It tends to occur at the same times every day.   - Sinus headache causes pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning.   - Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome.   - Headache due to a disorder called temporal arteritis. This is a swollen, inflamed artery that supplies blood to part of the head, temple, and neck area.      In rare cases, a headache can be a sign of something more serious, such as:     - Bleeding in the area between the brain and the thin tissue that covers the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage)   - Blood pressure that is very high   - Brain infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis, or abscess   - Brain tumor   - Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (hydrocephalus)   - Buildup of pressure inside the skull that appears to be, but is not a tumor (pseudotumor cerebri)   - Carbon monoxide poisoning   - Lack of oxygen during sleep (sleep apnea)   - Problems with the blood vessels and bleeding in the brain, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain aneurysm, or stroke",

            "knowledge": "Pulmonary hypertension (Causes): Your heart has two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles). Each time blood passes through your heart, the lower right chamber (right ventricle) pumps blood to your lungs through a large blood vessel (pulmonary artery). In your lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The oxygen-rich blood then flows through blood vessels in your lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of your heart. Ordinarily, the blood flows easily through the vessels in your lungs, so blood pressure is usually much lower in your lungs. With pulmonary hypertension, the rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, and extra tissue may form. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. These changes in the pulmonary arteries can reduce or block blood flow through the blood vessels. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension - Cause unknown, known as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension   - A specific gene mutation that can cause pulmonary hypertension to develop in families, also called heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension   - Certain drugs - such as certain prescription diet drugs or illegal drugs such as methamphetamines - or certain toxins   - Heart abnormalities present at birth (congenital heart disease)   - Other conditions, such as connective tissue disorders (scleroderma, lupus, others), HIV infection or chronic liver disease (cirrhosis) Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease - Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease   - Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema   - Lung disease such as pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that causes scarring in the tissue between the lungs' air sacs (interstitium)   - Sleep apnea and other sleep disorders   - Long-term exposure to high altitudes in people who may be at higher risk of pulmonary hypertension Group 4: Pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic blood clots - Chronic blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary emboli) Group 5: Pulmonary hypertension associated with other conditions that have unclear reasons why the pulmonary hypertension occurs - Blood disorders   - Disorders that affect several organs in the body, such as sarcoidosis   - Metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage disease   - Tumors pressing against pulmonary arteries Eisenmenger syndrome and pulmonary hypertension Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of congenital heart disease, causes pulmonary hypertension. It's most commonly caused by a large hole in your heart between the two lower heart chambers (ventricles), called a ventricular septal defect. This hole in your heart causes blood to circulate abnormally in your heart. Oxygen-carrying blood (red blood) mixes with oxygen-poor blood (blue blood). The blood then returns to your lungs instead of going to the rest of your body, increasing the pressure in the pulmonary arteries and causing pulmonary hypertension.",

            "knowledge": "Hypoglycemia (Causes): Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low. There are several reasons why this may happen, the most common is a side effect of drugs used to treat diabetes. Blood sugar regulation But to understand how hypoglycemia happens, it helps to know how your body normally processes blood sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down carbohydrates from foods - such as bread, rice, pasta, vegetables, fruit and milk products - into various sugar molecules, including glucose. Glucose is the main energy source for your body, but it can't enter the cells of most of your tissues without the help of insulin - a hormone secreted by your pancreas. When glucose levels rise, certain cells (beta cells) in your pancreas release insulin. This allows glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need to function properly. Any extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. If you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose back into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar level within a normal range until you eat again. Aside from your liver breaking down glycogen into glucose, your body also has the ability to manufacture glucose. This process occurs primarily in your liver, but also in your kidneys. Possible causes, with diabetes People with diabetes may not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or may be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose tends to build up in the bloodstream and may reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, someone with diabetes may take insulin or other drugs to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too low, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may also happen if you don't eat as much food as usual after taking diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you normally would. Possible causes, without diabetes Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes may include the following: - Medications. Taking someone else's oral diabetes medication accidentally is a possible cause of hypoglycemia. Other medications may cause hypoglycemia, especially in children or in people with kidney failure. One example is quinine (Qualaquin), which is used to treat malaria.   - Excessive alcohol consumption. Drinking heavily without eating can block your liver from releasing stored glucose into your bloodstream, causing hypoglycemia.   - Some critical illnesses. Severe illnesses of the liver, such as severe hepatitis, can cause hypoglycemia. Disorders of the kidney, which can keep your body from properly excreting medications, can affect glucose levels due to a buildup of those medications. Long-term starvation, as may occur in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, can result in the depletion of substances your body needs to generate glucose (gluconeogenesis), causing hypoglycemia.   - Insulin overproduction. A rare tumor of the pancreas (insulinoma) may cause overproduction of insulin, resulting in hypoglycemia. Other tumors may result in excessive production of insulin-like substances. Enlargement of beta cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (nesidioblastosis) may result in excessive insulin release, causing hypoglycemia.   - Hormone deficiencies. Certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland can result in a deficiency of key hormones that regulate glucose production. Children may experience hypoglycemia if they have a deficiency of growth hormone. Hypoglycemia after meals Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten (when you're in a fasting state), but that's not always the case. Sometimes hypoglycemia occurs after meals because the body produces more insulin than is needed. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia, may occur in people who have had stomach surgery. It may also occur in people who haven't had this surgery.",

            "knowledge": "Pneumonia (Causes): Bacteria, viruses, and fungi infections can cause pneumonia. These infections cause inflammation in the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs. This inflammation causes the air sacs to fill with fluid and pus. Bacteria Bacteria are the most common cause of pneumonia in adults. Many types of bacteria can cause bacterial pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae or pneumococcus bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the United States. If your pneumonia is caused by one of the following types of bacteria, it is called atypical pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila. This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains. Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However, Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and hemolysis. This type of bacteria is a common cause of “walking pneumonia”. Chlamydia pneumoniae. This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a viral cold or the flu. Bacterial pneumonia often affects just one lobe, or area, of a lung. When this happens, the condition is called lobar pneumonia. Read more Most of the time, the body filters bacteria out of the air that we breathe to protect the lungs from infection. Your immune system, the shape of your nose and throat, your ability to cough, and fine, hair-like structures called cilia help stop the germs from reaching your lungs. Read How the Lungs Work for more information. Sometimes bacteria manage to enter the lungs and cause infections. This is more likely to occur if: Your immune system is weak A germ is very strong Your body fails to filter out the bacteria from the air that you breathe. For example, if you can't cough because you've had a stroke or are sedated, bacteria may remain in your airways. When bacteria reach your lungs, your immune system goes into action. It sends many kinds of cells to attack the bacteria. These cells cause inflammation in alveoli (air sacs) and can cause these spaces to fill up with fluid and pus. This causes the symptoms of pneumonia. Viruses Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. The influenza or flu virus is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of viral pneumonia in children younger than one year old.  Other viruses can cause pneumonia such as the common cold virus known as rhinovirus, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). Most cases of viral pneumonia are mild. They get better in about one to three weeks without treatment. Some cases are more serious and may require treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you run the risk of getting bacterial pneumonia. Fungi Pneumocystis pneumonia is a serious fungal infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It occurs in people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS or the long-term use of medicines that suppress their immune systems, such as those used to treat cancer or as part of organ or blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures. Other fungal infections also can lead to pneumonia. The following are three fungi that occur in the soil in some parts of the United States and can cause some people to get pneumonia. Coccidioidomycosis. This fungus is found in Southern California and the desert Southwest. It is the cause of valley fever. Histoplasmosis. This fungus is found in the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys. Cryptococcus. This fungus is found throughout the United States in bird droppings and soil contaminated with bird droppings.",

The childhood cerebral form is the most severe, with onset between ages 4 and 10. The most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression, poor memory, and poor school performance. Other symptoms include visual loss, learning disabilities, seizures, poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, disturbances of gait and coordination, fatigue, intermittent vomiting, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive dementia. Adrenoleukodystrophy is a family of hereditary disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. Adrenoleukodystrophy is usually passed down from parent to child as an X-linked genetic trait. It affects mostly males, although some women can have milder forms of the disease. The genetic mutation causes buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes, which disrupts their normal activity.  Childhood cerebral form  appears at ages 4 to 8. Its symptoms include changes in muscle tone, muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements, crossed eyes, difficulty at school, difficulty understanding what people are saying, hearing loss, and hyperactivity. Worsening nervous system damage, may include coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis, seizures, swallowing difficulties, visual impairment or blindness.  A long-term coma (vegetative state) could start about 2 years after nervous system symptoms develop and last as long as 10 years, until death occurs.  A specific treatment for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is not available. A bone marrow transplant can cure people of the condition. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited  condition that occurs mostly in males, and  affects the nervous system and the adrenal glands  located on top of each kidney.   Treatments for X-ALD are not currently available. ,Eating a diet low in very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) and taking special oils can lower the blood levels of VLCFA, which might reduce damage to the adrenal cortex and myelin.

Anal fissures, small tears in the tissues that line the anus, could be caused by hard stools, chronic diarrhea   and inflammation of the anorectal area, and some less common problems. Factors that increase the risk of developing an anal feature include: decreased blood flow to the rectal area due to aging; straining during bowel movements, e.g., due to constipation; chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract; and anal intercourse. Anal fissures are likely to heal within weeks if you keep your stool soft, e.g., by increasing fiber and fluids in your diet, and relax the sphincter by soaking in warm water for 10-20 minutes after bowel movements. If the fissures persist, your doctor may recommend medications to relax the sphincter, such as nitroglycerin applied externally (Rectiv), Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injection, or oral blood pressure medications, such as nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) . Topical anesthetics, e.g.,  lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocaine) may relieve pain. For chronic fissures, surgery might be more effective. The procedure called lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing. Several factors increase the risk of developing an anal feature: decreased blood flow to the rectal area due to aging; straining during bowel movements, e.g., due to constipation; chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract; and anal intercourse. Common causes of anal fissure include: hard stools, constipation, chronic diarrhea, and inflammation of the anorectal area. Less common causes of anal fissures include: anal cancer, HIV, tuberculosis, syphilis, and herpes Doctors may be able to diagnose an anal fissure by observation, performing a digital rectal exam or using an anoscope. Further testing may  be needed if your doctor thinks you have an underlying condition. Lifestyle changes that prevent constipation and soften stools may promote healing of an anal fissure. These changes include:  gradually adding up to 25-30 grams of fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and whole grains  to your diet; drinking sufficient amount of fluids; regular moderate exercise, such as walking. Additionally, avoid straining during bowel movements.

The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive form of muscular dystrophy that occurs primarily in males, though in rare cases may affect females. Early signs of DMD may include delayed ability to sit, stand, or walk and difficulties learning to speak. Muscle weakness is usually noticeable by 3 or 4 years of age and begins in the hips, pelvic area, upper legs, and shoulders.

It occurs most often in men over 50 years old. There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.  Squamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and drinking too much alcohol. Adenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having Barrett esophagus increases the risk of this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese. Symptoms may include: backward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth, called regurgitation; chest pain; difficulty swallowing solids or liquids; heartburn; vomiting blood ; and weight loss. Your doctor may use the following tests to diagnose esophageal cancer: barium swallow, MRI, CT, endoscopic ultrasound, PET scan, and endoscopy to obtain a tissue sample for biopsy. If  the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery or radiation therapy will be done. Chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform. If the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms.  Beside a change in diet, other treatments may be used to help the patient swallow. Joining a cancer support group can help you not feel alone.

Physical therapists and other specialists could explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly. Most children with scoliosis have mild curves and do not need treatment. If your child's bones are still growing and he or she has moderate scoliosis, your doctor may recommend a brace. To start treatment with braces the doctors will consider the following: risk of progression is higher in girls, larger or double curves, also known as S-shaped curves are more likely to worsen, curves located in the center (thoracic) section of the spine worsen more often, and child's age. If a child's bones have stopped growing, the risk of curve progression is low.  For severe scoliosis, your doctor might suggest surgery to reduce the severity of the spinal curve and to prevent it from getting worse. The most common type of scoliosis surgery is called spinal fusion. In spinal fusion, surgeons connect two or more of the bones in the spine (vertebrae) together. Treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis may involve observation, bracing and/or surgery. Treatment recommendations are generally dependent upon the risk of curve progression. If  you are still growing and have mild scoliosis, your doctor will observe and examine you every few months. If the curve is moderate, your doctor may recommend a brace that must be worn  every day for the full number of hours prescribed by the doctor.

            "knowledge": "To reach and stay at a healthy weight, you may need to work with a dietitian, behavior counselor or an obesity specialist.  They will help you understand and make changes in your eating habits and increase physical activity. The treatment methods that are right for you depend on your level of obesity, your overall health and your willingness to participate in your weight-loss plan. In addition to dietary changes, exercise and activity, and behavior changes, you may need prescription weight-loss medications or weight-loss surgery. Treatment for obesity includes lifestyle changes, such as gradually decreasing total calorie intake, eating healthy,  getting the  physical activity recommended by your doctor, and getting enough sleep. Behavioral weight-loss treatment programs may be needed to  help you make and maintain these lifestyle changes.  When healthy lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may consider medications that decrease appetite, such as diethylpropion, phendimetrazine, lorcaserin, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide.  Alternatively, orlistat blocks intestines from absorbing fat from foods. Patients who do not respond to lifestyle changes and medications, and develop complications, may  be eligible for gastric bypass, gastrectomy. or gastric banding. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the benefits and risks of each type of surgery. Genetic differences may affect how much weight loss patients experience after bariatric surgery. The safest way to lose weight is to change your behavior for a long term and lead an active lifestyle, exercise and eat healthy. Work with your doctor and dietitian to lose weight while staying healthy. Make healthy food choices, read nutritional labels, and change the way you prepare food and snack. Reduce portion sizes and avoid sweetened drinks and extreme diets. Discuss supplements and herbal remedies with your doctor. If diet, exercise, or medicine do not help, discuss with your doctor if one of the following surgeries is a good  option for you: laparoscopic gastric banding, gastric bypass surgery, sleeve gastrectomy, or duodenal switch. Sometimes your doctors may suggest drugs approved for treating medical problems other than obesity. Before using such medications, discuss them with your doctor. A healthy eating plan and regular physical activity may help you lose weight and keep it off over the long term. If these lifestyle changes are not enough, your doctor may prescribe medications. Some medications may help you feel less hungry or full sooner. Other medications may make it harder for your body to absorb fat from the foods you eat. Weight-loss medications are for people who may have health problems related to overweight or obesity. When combined with changes to behavior, including eating and physical activity habits, prescription medications may help some people lose weight. Children and adolescents could modify their diet to gradually lose weight through a healthy diet and increased physical activity. The diet should include fruits and vegetables, and cut back on cookies, crackers, prepared meals, sweetened beverages, such as fruit juice, fast food and eating out.  Sit down together for family meals, control portion sizes and discourage eating in front of a TV, computer or video game screen. Allow eaving food on the plate. Physical activity for at least an hour a day burns calories, strengthens bones and muscles, and helps children sleep well at night and stay alert during the day.  Physical activity doesn't have to be an exercise program: free-play activities, such as playing hide-and-seek, tag or jump-rope will get the child moving. The value and long-term outcomes of medications or surgery are unknown and need to be discussed with specialists. The effectiveness and safety of dietary supplements that promise to help loose weight are often questionable. Ask your doctor before taking any dietary supplements. Acupuncture, mindfulness meditation and yoga may complement other obesity treatments, but these  mind-body therapies haven't been well-studied in the treatment of weight loss.",

            "knowledge": "Symptoms of endometriosis include heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding between periods, problems getting pregnant. The primary symptoms of endometriosis are pain and infertility. Other common symptoms of endometriosis include: painful, even debilitating, menstrual cramps, pain during or after sex, pain in the intestine or lower abdomen, painful bowel movements or painful urination during menstrual periods, heavy menstrual periods, premenstrual spotting or bleeding between periods, painful bladder syndrome, digestive or gastrointestinal symptoms similar to a bowel disorder, as well as fatigue, tiredness, or lack of energy. Endometriosis pain may get milder after pregnancy or menopause.  In some cases, inflammation and chemicals produced by the endometriosis patches can cause the pelvic organs to stick together, causing scar tissue. This makes the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as the bladder and rectum, appear as one large organ. Over time, some endometriosis areas may form nodules or bumps as they create lesions on the surface of pelvic organs or can become cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries. Some endometriosis lesions have nerves in them.  Pain from endometriosis can be severe, interfering with day-to-day activities. Endometriosis is often associated with pelvic pain before and during menstrual period, lower back and abdominal pain, and pain during or after sex, bowel movements or urination.  Women with endometriosis  may experience heavy periods, bleeding between periods, and Infertility. Endometriosis occurs when cells from the lining of the womb (uterus) grow in other areas of the body. This can cause pain, heavy bleeding, bleeding between periods, and problems getting pregnant (infertility). In women with endometriosis, the tissue that lines the uterus grows elsewhere, e.g., on the ovaries, behind the uterus or on the bowels or bladder.  This tissue may cause pain in the abdomen, lower back or pelvic areas; infertility; and heavy periods.  Pain medicines and hormones often help. Severe cases may need surgery. There are also treatments to improve fertility in women with endometriosis. Up to 50% of women with endometriosis may have fertility problems. Women with endometriosis are at a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer. Rarely, they may also have breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In about quarter of women diagnosed with endometriosis, endometriosis patches go away on their own. Symptoms also lessen after menopause. If the systems persist, discuss treatment options with your doctor. Contact your doctor if experience back pain after endometriosis is treated. Get screened for endometriosis if your mother or sister has it or if you are unable to become pregnant after trying for 1 year Endometriosis can cause fertility problems, long-term pelvic pain, or cysts in the pelvis. Endometriosis tissue may block the intestines or urinary tract. Cancer may develop in the areas of tissue growth after menopause. Endometriosis occurs when cells from the lining of the uterus grow in other areas of the body. This can cause swelling and pain, and problems getting pregnant.",

            "message": "Endometriosis occurs when cells from the lining of the womb (uterus) grow in other areas of the body. The primary symptoms of endometriosis are pain and infertility. Other common symptoms of endometriosis include: painful, even debilitating, menstrual cramps, pain during or after sex, pain in the intestine or lower abdomen, painful bowel movements or painful urination during menstrual periods, heavy menstrual periods, premenstrual spotting or bleeding between periods, painful bladder syndrome, digestive or gastrointestinal symptoms similar to a bowel disorder, as well as fatigue, tiredness, or lack of energy.  In about quarter of women diagnosed with endometriosis, endometriosis patches go away on their own.  Endometriosis pain may get milder after pregnancy or menopause.  In some cases, inflammation and chemicals produced by the endometriosis patches can cause the pelvic organs to stick together, causing scar tissue. This makes the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as the bladder and rectum, appear as one large organ. Over time, some endometriosis areas may form nodules or bumps as they create lesions on the surface of pelvic organs or can become cysts (fluid-filled sacs) on the ovaries. Some endometriosis lesions have nerves in them.  Women with endometriosis are at a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer. Rarely, they may also have breast cancer or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Pain from endometriosis can be severe, interfering with day-to-day activities. If the systems persist, discuss treatment options with your doctor."

Blood pressure medications, by mouth or applied externally, such as oral nifedipine (Procardia) or diltiazem (Cardizem) can help relax the anal sphincter.  If you have a chronic anal fissure that is resistant to other treatments, or if your symptoms are severe, your doctor may recommend surgery, which involves cutting a small portion of the anal sphincter muscle to reduce spasm and pain, and promote healing.  Studies have found that for chronic fissure, surgery is much more effective than any medical treatment. However, surgery has a small risk of causing incontinence. Home remedies for anal fissures include preventing hard stools and constipation by eating more fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains, drinking more fluids, and using stool softeners. Your doctor may recommend ointments or creams to help soothe the affected skin, such as numbing cream, petroleum jelly, zinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, and Preparation H. A warm water bath  2 to 3 times a day may help healing  and cleansing. The water should cover only the hips and buttocks. If the anal fissures do not go away with home care methods, your doctor may recommend botox injections into the muscle in the anus (anal sphincter), minor surgery to relax the anal muscle, prescription creams such as nitrates or calcium channel blockers, applied over the fissure to help relax the muscles.

            "knowledge": "SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is a kidney (renal) disorder that sometimes includes blood cell abnormalities. The kidneys normally filter fluid and waste products from the body and remove them in urine. in people with distal renal tubular acidosis, the kidneys are unable to remove enough acid from the body, and the blood becomes too acidic. This chemical imbalance is called metabolic acidosis. The inability to remove acids from the body often results in slowed growth and may also lead to softening and weakening of the bones, called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. This bone disorder is characterized by bone pain, bowed legs, and difficulty walking. In addition, most children and adults with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis have excess calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria), calcium deposits in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis), and kidney stones (nephrolithiasis). In rare cases, these kidney abnormalities lead to life-threatening kidney failure. Affected individuals may also have low levels of potassium in the blood (hypokalemia). Individuals with the features described above have complete distal renal tubular acidosis, which usually becomes apparent in childhood. Some people do not develop metabolic acidosis even though their kidneys have trouble removing acids; these individuals are said to have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Additionally, these individuals may have other features of distal renal tubular acidosis, such as bone problems and kidney stones. Often, people who initially have incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis develop metabolic acidosis later in life. Some people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis also have blood cell abnormalities. These can vary in severity from no symptoms to a condition called hemolytic anemia, in which red blood cells prematurely break down (undergo hemolysis), causing a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Hemolytic anemia can lead to unusually pale skin (pallor), extreme tiredness (fatigue), shortness of breath (dyspnea), and an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). There are two forms of SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis; they are distinguished by their inheritance pattern. The autosomal dominant form is more common and is usually less severe than the autosomal recessive form. The autosomal dominant form can be associated with incomplete or complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is rarely associated with blood cell abnormalities. The autosomal recessive form is always associated with complete distal renal tubular acidosis and is more commonly associated with blood cell abnormalities, although not everyone with this form has abnormal blood cells. SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis is caused by mutations in the SLC4A1 gene.  In people with SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis, the acid builds up in the blood, leading to metabolic acidosis and the other features of complete distal renal tubular acidosis. It is not clear why some people develop metabolic acidosis and others do not. Researchers suggest that in individuals with incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis, another mechanism is able to help regulate blood acidity (pH) and keep metabolic acidosis from developing.  Some people have nonhereditary forms of distal renal tubular acidosis; these forms can be caused by immune system problems or other conditions that damage the kidneys. These individuals often have additional signs and symptoms related to the original condition. SLC4A1-associated distal renal tubular acidosis can have different patterns of inheritance. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent. Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.",

Children with Tay-Sachs disease are at high risk of lung infections and may need chest physiotherapy (CPT) to help remove mucus from the lungs.   Your child may have trouble swallowing, or inhale food or liquid into the lungs while eating.  To prevent resulting respiratory problems, your doctor may recommend an assistive feeding device. As the disease progresses, physical therapy may help keep joints flexible and maintain the range of motion. Physical therapy can delay joint stiffness and reduce or delay the loss of function and pain that can result from shortened muscles. Gene therapy or enzyme replacement therapy research may eventually lead to a cure or treatment to slow the progression of Tay-Sachs disease. Tay-Sachs disease is caused by the harmful buildup of lipids in various cells and tissues in the body.  Affected children appear to develop normally until about age 6 months.  Then, symptoms begin and include progressive loss of mental ability, dementia, blindness, increased startle reflex to noise, progressive loss of hearing leading to deafness, and difficulty with swallowing.  Seizures may begin in the child's second year. Persons with Tay-Sachs also have \"cherry-red\" spots in their eyes.  Affected individuals and carriers of Tay-Sachs disease can be identified by a blood test. Both parents of a child that inherits this metabolic disease must have the mutated gene.

            "knowledge": "Menkes syndrome is caused by a defect in the ATP7A gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to distribute copper in food from the intestines into the bloodstream for use in other areas. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper. Copper can build up in the small intestine and kidneys, but low copper levels in other areas can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function. Menkes syndrome is inherited, which means it runs in families. There is often a history of Menkes syndrome in a male relative. Symptoms of Menkes syndrome are bone spurs, brittle, kinky hair, feeding difficulties, irritability, lack of muscle tone, floppiness, low body temperature, mental deterioration, pudgy, rosy cheeks, seizures, skeletal changes, abnormal appearance of the hair, abnormally low body temperature, bleeding in the brain. slow growth in the womb. Treatment usually only helps when started very early in the course of the disease. Injections of copper into a vein or under the skin have been used with mixed results. Most people with this condition die within the first few years of life. Menkes syndrome is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body. The symptoms include kinky hair, failure to thrive, deterioration of the nervous system, weak muscle tone (hypotonia), sagging facial features, seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Children with Menkes syndrome typically begin to develop symptoms during infancy and often do not live past age 3. Early treatment with copper may improve the prognosis in some affected individuals. In rare cases, symptoms begin later in childhood. In Menkes syndrome, cells in the body can absorb copper, but they are unable to release it. Mutations in the ATP7A gene cause Menkes syndrome. These mutations prevent the production of functional ATP7A protein. As a result, the absorption of copper from food is impaired, and copper is not supplied to certain enzymes. The disrupted activity of the ATP7A protein causes copper to accumulate in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of Menkes syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes. Symptoms of Menkes syndrome include bone spurs, brittle kinky hair, feeding difficulties, irritability, lack of muscle tone, floppiness, low body temperature, mental deterioration, pudgy rosy cheeks, seizures, and skeletal changes.",

Cardiac amyloidosis affects the way electrical signals move through the heart, which can lead to abnormal heartbeats (arrhythmias) and faulty heart signals (heart block). The condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of inflammation. The complications of cardiac amyloidosis include atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites), increased sensitivity to digoxin, low blood pressure and dizziness from excessive urination, sick sinus syndrome, and cardiac conduction system disease (arrhythmias) Cardiac amyloidosis is a disorder caused by deposits of an abnormal protein (amyloid) in the heart tissue. These deposits make it hard for the heart to work properly. Different types of amyloidosis can affect the heart in different ways. Some types are more severe than others. Many people can now expect to survive and experience a good quality of life for several years after diagnosis. To treat cardiac amyloidosis you may need to make changes to your diet, including limiting salt and fluids, and take water pills (diuretics). People with cardiac amyloidosis may be extra sensitive to side effects of  digoxin, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-blockers that may be used for atrial fibrillation. Your doctor  may recommend chemotherapy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD), a pacemaker for problems with heart signals, and prednisone, an anti-inflammatory medicine. A heart transplant may be considered for people with some types of amyloidosis who have very poor heart function. People with hereditary amyloidosis may need a liver transplant. Some people with cardiac amyloidosis may have no symptoms. Others may experience excessive urination at night, fatigue, reduced exercise ability, heart palpitations, shortness of breath with activity or lying down, swelling of the abdomen, legs, ankles, or other part of the body.",

The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system such as brain tumor, cranial arteritis, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. There are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Optic atrophy 1 is usually caused by  mutations in the OPA1 gene , although some individuals with optic atrophy 1 do not have identified mutations in this gene, in which case the cause of the condition is unknown. This condition is inherited in an  autosomal dominant pattern but some cases result from a new mutation in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Optic atrophy type 1 is caused by mutations in the OPA1 gene. Mutations in the OPA1 gene lead to problems with mitochondrial function, which causes optic nerve atrophy and disruptions in transmitting visual information to the brain. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In most cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from one affected parent.

Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins between the ages of 40 and 60.  Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include sex, family history, smoking, environmental exposures, and obesity. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.  If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.  Cigarette smoking  also increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity. Although uncertain and poorly understood, some environmental exposures such as asbestos or silica may increase the risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis. People who are overweight or obese appear to be at somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in women diagnosed with the disease when they were 55 or younger. Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose in its early stages because the early signs and symptoms mimic those of many other diseases. Anyone can get arthritis, but it occurs more often in women and is most common in older people. Genes, environmental factors, and hormones may play roles in the development of rheumatoid arthritis.

For relapsing-remitting MS, several disease-modifying therapies are available. Currently there is no cure for Multiple Sclerosis. Many individuals do well with no therapy at all, especially since many medications have serious side effects and some carry significant risks.  However, three forms of beta interferon (Avonex, Betaseron, and Rebif) are approved for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS.  Ocrelizumab (brand name Ocrevus) is approved for adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Beta interferon has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations, the severity and duration of the attacks,  and may slow the progression of physical disability. A synthetic form of myelin basic protein, called copolymer I (Copaxone), is approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. Copolymer I has few side effects, and studies indicate that the agent can reduce the relapse rate by almost one third.  Other approved drugs to treat relapsing forms of MS in adults include teriflunomide and dimethyl fumarate.  An immunosuppressant treatment, Novantrone (mitoxantrone), is approved for the treatment of advanced or chronic MS.  Dalfampridine (Ampyra) may improve walking in individuals with MS. One monoclonal antibody, natalizumab (Tysabri), was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce the frequency of attacks in people with relapsing forms of MS. This drug should be used under strict treatment guidelines involving infusion centers where patients can be monitored by specially trained physicians.  Steroids can reduce the duration and severity of attacks in some patients.  Spasticity, which can occur either as a sustained stiffness caused by increased muscle tone or as spasms that come and go, is usually treated with muscle relaxants and tranquilizers such as baclofen, tizanidine, diazepam, clonazepam, and dantrolene. Physical therapy and exercise can help preserve remaining function, and patients may find that various aids -- such as foot braces, canes, and walkers -- can help them remain independent and mobile.  Avoiding excessive activity and avoiding heat are probably the most important measures patients can take to counter physiological fatigue.  If psychological symptoms of fatigue such as depression or apathy are evident, antidepressant medications may help.  Other drugs that may reduce fatigue in some, but not all, patients include amantadine (Symmetrel), pemoline (Cylert), and aminopyridine. Although improvement of optic symptoms usually occurs even without treatment, a short course of treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) followed by treatment with oral steroids is sometimes used.

The vast majority of patients are mildly affected, but in the worst cases, MS can render a person unable to write, speak, or walk.  MS is a disease with a natural tendency to remit spontaneously, for which there is no universally effective treatment."

Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness. A Epilepsy is a  brain disorder in which permanent changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable,  As a result, the brain sends out abnormal signals that cause repeated, unpredictable seizures. Epilepsy is a brain disorder in which a person has repeated seizures over time that are caused by a sudden change in the electrical and chemical activity in the brain. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected.  Epilepsy is often a lifelong  illness that requires taking medicines  and taking precautions to stay safe, such as never swimming alone, fall-proofing your home and so on. People with epilepsy need to manage stress and sleep, avoiding alcohol and drug abuse, keeping up in school, and manage other illnesses. Some types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s. If the child does not have seizures for a few years, the doctor may stop medicines. For many children, epilepsy is a lifelong condition. In these cases, the medicines need to be continued. There is no known way to prevent epilepsy. Proper diet and sleep may decrease the chances of seizures in children with epilepsy. To decrease the likelihood of a brain injury that leads to seizures and epilepsy, reduce the risk of head injury during risky activities. Epilepsy seizures and muscle contractions are present in a group of rare hereditary disorders called Progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME.) Many  PME diseases begin in childhood or adolescence, get worse over time and sometimes are fatal. A form of epilepsy, Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a  genetic disorder that typically starts between 9 and 13 years.  JAE manifests with sporadic absence seizures  -- ''staring spell'' that can be accompanied by drooping of the head and/or automatisms such as lip smacking.  JAE  may be associated with life-long generalized tonic-clonic seizures and sporadic myoclonic jerks. Epilepsy is a component of about 200 currently reported case of Celiac disease, Epilepsy and Cerebral calcification syndrome (CEC) , which is a combination of auto-immune intestinal disease, epileptic seizures and cerebral calcifications.  Most cases of epilepsy start in early childhood with occipital epileptic seizures. The patients may have benign, drug-resistant, or epileptic encephalopathy forms of the disease. Epileptic encephalopathy may lead to severe mental deterioration and learning disorders.",

It is possible to do so by eating healthy foods, exercising, quitting smoking, controlling high blood pressure, and managing diabetes. The treatment for dementia depends on the type of dementia. Alzheimer's or Huntington's disease are progressive, and while they can be slowed, they cannot be halted or reversed. However, treatment for other types of dementia can do so. Some types of dementia cannot be prevented, such as Alzheimer's, though their progression can be slowed. Others can be halted or reversed with appropriate treatment. There are drug-based and treatment-based treatments for dementia. There are drugs that specifically treat Alzheimers disease and other progressive dementias. These drugs do not halt or reverse the disease, but they can slow its progression. The therapeutic-based approaches include practicing tasks designed to improve memory, attention, and other cognitive abilities. These tasks are not designed to prevent dementia but slow its progression. There is no cure for most types of dementia, but there are treatments to manage your symptoms. Medications such as donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) and galantamine (Razadyne) work by boosting levels of a chemical messenger involved in memory and judgement. There are also nondrug approaches such as occupational therapy. An occupational therapist can teach you behaviors to make living with dementia easier. They can help you prevent accidents such as falls, and prepare you for the progression of the disease. Symptoms of vascular dementia can begin suddenly and worsen or improve over one's lifetime. For this type of dementia, drugs that prevent strokes can be prescribed. These do not prevent the progression of the dementia, but do reduce the risk of brain damage caused by strokes.",

            "knowledge": "The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension can be causes by autoimmune diseases, birth defects of the heart, heart failure, blood clots in the lungs, heart failure or heart valve disease, HIV, lung diseases, or some medicines. There are many causes of pulmonary hypertension. For this reason, many tests may be required to find the cause of your particular case. The heart has two upper chambers and two lower chambers. When blood passes through the heart, the lower right chamber pumps blood to your lungs through the pulmonary artery. Once in the lungs, the blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen. The blood then flows through blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins) to the left side of the heart. However, with pulmonary hypertension, the walls of the arteries become stiff and thick. The blood vessels may also become inflamed and tight. This makes it harder for blood to flow, raising the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. For most individuals diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension, there is no known family history. About 20 percent of these cases are caused by mutations in one of the genes associated with the disease; however, for most cases a single causative gene has not been identified. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes make it more difficult for your heart to push blood through your pulmonary arteries. This causes the pressure in your arteries to rise, causing PH.",

            "knowledge": "If you have inherited hemophilia A, you will require life-long care, potentially through a hemophilia treatment center. There is no cure for hemophilia A, but the available treatments usually work well. Treatment primarily involves replacing the missing clotting factor VII, as well as preventing any complications associated with the disorder. The type and frequency of of treatment depends on the severity. If your hemophilia is may, you may only need treatment when a bleeding episode occurs. However, if it is more severe, you will require routine treatments to prevent bleeding episodes and any associated complications. Treatment of hemophilia A involves replacing the missing clotting factor A. For some people, the clotting factor can be given at the first sign of a bleeding crisis. For people with more severe hemophilia, preventative treatments should be given. Mild hemophilia may be treated with desmopressin (DDAVP). This medicine helps the body release factor VIII that is stored within the lining of blood vessels. The most common way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing clotting factor intravenously. If you need to have surgery, be sure to tell your doctor that you have hemophilia. The main way to treat hemophilia is with replacement therapy. This is where clotting factor VIII (for hemophilia A) or clotting factor IX (for hemophilia B) are dripped or injected intravenously. These infusions help replenish the missing or low clotting factor. You may receive a preventative treatment, or you may receive treatment only to stop bleeding when it occurs. However, the latter treatment may not be able to stop damage before it occurs.",

You can adopt heart-healthy eating habits, be as physically active as you can, avoid smoking, or work with your doctor to create a reasonable weight-loss plan. You can control some risk factors of atherosclerosis, such as lack of physical activity, smoking, and an unhealthy diet. Other factors are not controllable. The main treatment is lifestyle changes. You may also need medicines and medical procedures. Treatments for atherosclerosis have reduced the deaths due to the disease. These treatments also have improved the quality of life for people who have these diseases. You should follow your treatment plan and take all of your medicines as your doctor prescribes. Your doctor will let you know how often you should schedule office visits or blood tests. You can control most risk factors and help prevent or delay atherosclerosis. Major risk factors include unhealthy blood cholesterol levels, high LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, an unhealthy diet, or a family history of heart disease. Treatments for atherosclerosis may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes, medicines, and medical procedures or surgery. The goals of treatment are to lower your risk of blood clots, preventing atherosclerosis-related diseases, reducing risk factors for plaque buildup, and widening or bypassing plaque-clogged arteries. Lifestyle changes and treating high cholesterol levels can slow or prevent the process of hardening of the arteries. Doing so will reduce the chances of having a heart attack and stroke as a result of atherosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis occurs when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from your heart to the rest of your body become thick and stiff - sometimes restricting blood flow to your organs and tissues. Early diagnosis and treatment can stop atherosclerosis from worsening and prevent a heart attack, stroke or another medical emergency. Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising, are often the most appropriate treatment for atherosclerosis. Sometimes, medication or surgical procedures may be recommended as well.",

This is because bingeing and purging is most often done in private. However, family or friends may see empty food wrappers in unexpected places or vomit in the home. People with bulimia often have other mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, or substance abuse. For people with bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. he person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating. Binges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain. Purging may include using laxatives, enemas, or diuretics. People with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder. Symptoms that other people can see include spending a large amount of time exercising, suddenly eating large amounts of food, regularly going to the bathroom after meals, or throwing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (drugs that cause vomiting), or diuretics. Bulimia signs and symptoms may include being preoccupied with your body shape and weight, living in fear of gaining weight, feeling that you can't control your eating behavior, or eating until the point of discomfort or pain. People with bulimia may eat much more in a binge episode than in a normal meal or snack, and may force themselves to vomit or exercise to keep from gaining weight after bingeing. They may also misuse laxatives, diuretics or enemas after eating, or restrict calories or avoid certain foods between binges. If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help as soon as possible. If left untreated, bulimia can severely impact your health. Talk to your primary care provider or a mental health provider about your bulimia symptoms and feelings.  If you're reluctant to seek treatment, confide in someone about what you're going through, whether it's a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. People with bulimia may secretly binge - eating large amounts of food - and then purge, trying to get rid of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. For example, someone with bulimia may force vomiting or engage in excessive exercise. Sometimes people purge after eating only a small snack or a normal-size meal. Bulimia can be categorized in two ways: Purging and nonpurging bulimia. With purging bulimia, you regularly self-induce vomiting or misuse laxatives, diuretics or enemas after bingeing. Nonpurging bulimia involves using other methods to rid yourself of calories and prevent weight gain, such as fasting, strict dieting or excessive exercise. However, these behaviors often overlap, and the attempt to rid yourself of extra calories is usually referred to as purging, no matter what the method.

This is because the body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by eating more food than your body can use, drinking too much alcohol, or not getting enough exercise. Many obese people who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system does not work normally. Childhood obesity can be caused by too little activity and too many calories from food or drinks. These are the main contributors to childhood obesity. Genetic and hormonal factors also play a role as well. The health and weight of the mother before she conceives can affect childhood obesity.

            "knowledge": "The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal. When blood passes through the heart, the lower right chamber pumps blood to your lungs through the pulmonary artery. From your lungs the blood flows to the left side of the heart. With pulmonary hypertension, the cells that line your pulmonary arteries become stiff and thick, making it harder for blood to flow. This raises the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in your lungs and the right side of your heart. The rise in blood pressure is caused by changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. These changes can cause the walls of the arteries to become stiff and thick, which makes it harder for blood to flow. This increase in pressure can cause your heart muscles to weaken and fail. Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension may be greater for a few reasons. These include if you're a young adult, you're overweight, you have a family history of the disease, you use illegal drugs, you take certain appetite-suppressant medications, you have an existing risk of developing pulmonary hypertension, or you live at a high altitude. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. Other factors can also cause PH. For example, if the walls of the arteries tighten, blood clots may become stiff from an overgrowth of cells. The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition.  In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. For example group 1 PAH includes PAH that has no known cause.  Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions.",

If you take them more than a couple of days a week, they may cause rebound headaches. Rebound headaches usually stop when you stop taking the pain medication. A number of factors can cause your child to develop headaches. These factors include illness and infection, stress and anxiety, genetic factors, depression, or problems in the brain. Some headaches can be dangerous, if they are related to problems with blood vessels and bleeding in the brain. These types of headaches may be caused by abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth. Other possible causes include a stroke, a brain aneurysm, high blood pressure, or carbon monoxide poisoning. Sex headaches are headaches caused by any type of sexual activity. They may be associated with the following: a widening or bubble in the wall of an artery inside your head (intracranial aneurysm); an abnormal connection between arteries and veins in the brain (arteriovenous malformation) that bleeds into the spinal fluid-filled space in and around the brain; bleeding into the wall of an artery leading to the brain (dissection); stroke; coronary artery disease; or use of some medications, such as birth control pills. Spinal headaches are caused by leakage of spinal fluid through a puncture hold in the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord. The decreases the pressure exerted by the spinal fluid on the brain and spinal cord, which leads to a headache. Serious causes of headaches are rare. Most people with headaches can feel much better by making lifestyle changes, learning ways to relax, and sometimes by taking medicines. The most common type of headache is tension headache, which may be related to stress, depression, anxiety, a head injury, or holding your head and neck in an abnormal position. Migraines may be triggered by foods, such as chocolate, certain cheeses, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Caffeine withdrawal, lack of sleep, and alcohol may also be triggers. Rebound headaches are headaches that keep coming back. They often occur from overuse of pain medicines. Other types of headaches include cluster headache, which is a sharp, very painful headache that occurs daily, sometimes up to several times a day for months. It then goes away for weeks to months. In some people, the headaches never come back. Sinus headaches cause pain in the front of the head and face. It is due to swelling in the sinus passages behind the cheeks, nose, and eyes. The pain is worse when you bend forward and when you first wake up in the morning. Headaches may occur if you have a cold, the flu, a fever, or premenstrual syndrome.

            "knowledge": "The right side of the heart pumps blood through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body. When the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension may be caused by autoimmune diseases that damage the lungs, birth defects of the heart, blood clots in the lung, heart failure, heart valve disease, lung disease, certain medicines, sleep apnea. In rare cases, the cause is unknown. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal. With Pulmonary hypertension, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is  increased because the walls of the pulmonary arteries stiffen and thicken. These changes make it harder for blood to flow, which raises the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Pulmonary hypertension is a type of high blood pressure caused by the walls of the pulmonary arteries stiffening and thickening. These changes make it harder for blood to flow, which raises the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. This means that the heart has to work harder to pump blood through your lungs, which causes the heart muscle to weaken and fail. Your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) may be greater if you're a young adult, overweight, have a family history of PH, have a condition that increases the risk of PH, use illegal drugs, or have another existing risk of developing PH. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) begins with inflammation and changes in the cells that line your pulmonary arteries. It can also be caused by the tightening of the walls of the arteries, or if they are stiff at birth or from overgrown cells. These changes make it difficult for your heart to pump blood through your pulmonary arteries and into your lungs. This causes the blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries to rise. The World Health Organization divides pulmonary hypertension (PH) into five groups. These groups are organized based on the cause of the condition. In all groups, the average pressure in the pulmonary arteries is higher than 25 mmHg at rest or 30 mmHg during physical activity. The pressure in normal pulmonary arteries is 820 mmHg at rest. Group 1 PAH includes: PAH that has no known cause. PAH that's inherited; PAH that's caused by drugs or toxins, such as street drugs and certain diet medicines; and PAH that's caused by conditions such as connective tissue diseases , HIV infection, liver disease, or congenital heart disease. Group 2 includes PH with left heart disease. Conditions that affect the left side of the heart, such as mitral valve disease or long-term high blood pressure, can cause left heart disease and PH. Group 3 includes PH associated with lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and interstitial (IN-ter-STISH-al) lung diseases. Interstitial lung diseases cause scarring of the lung tissue. Group 4 includes PH caused by blood clots in the lungs or blood clotting disorders. Group 5 includes PH caused by various other diseases or conditions.",

This build up of promyelocytes leads to a shortage of normal white and red blood cells and platelets in the body. The signs and symptoms of APL include an increased risk to both bleed and form blood clots. Individuals may also experience excessive tiredness, pain in affected areas, loss of appetite, and weight loss.[1][2] APL usually occurs in middle-aged adults, but can be diagnosed at any age. It is caused by a mutation that is acquired over a person's lifetime, usually involving a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17.[2] Treatment may include the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide or anthracycline-based chemotherapy .[3][4]  Most cases of APL are treated with an anthracycline chemotherapy drug (daunorubicin or idarubicin) plus the non-chemotherapy drug, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which is a relative of vitamin A.

In some cases, a manmade (synthetic) bone substitute is used.You will be asleep and feel no pain (general anesthesia).During surgery, the surgeon makes a cut over the bone defect. The bone graft can be taken from areas close to the bone defect or more commonly from the pelvis. The bone graft is shaped and inserted into and around the area. The bone graft can be held in place with pins, plates, or screws.  You will be asleep and feel no pain (general anesthesia). The doctor will make a surgical cut (incision)to view the spine. Other surgery, such as a diskectomy, laminectomy, or a foraminotomy, is almost always done first. Spinal fusionmay be done: - On your back or neck over the spine. You will be lying face down. Muscles and tissue will be separated to expose the spine. - On your side, if you are having surgery on your lower back. The surgeon will use tools called retractors to gently separate, hold the soft tissues and blood vessels apart, and have room to work. - With a cut on the front of the neck, toward the side. The surgeon will use a graft (such as bone) to hold (or fuse) the bones together permanently. There are several ways of fusing vertebrae together: - Strips of bone graft materialmay be placed over the back part of the spine. - Bone graft material may be placed between the vertebrae. - Special cages may be placed between the vertebrae. These cages are packed with bone graft material. The surgeon may get the bone graft from different places: - From another part of your body (usually around your pelvic bone).

However, during recurrences, antiviral drugs such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir, may relieve discomfort slightly and help symptoms resolve a day or two sooner (see table Some Antiviral Drugs for Herpesvirus Infections). Treatment is most effective if started early, usually within a few hours after symptoms startpreferably at the first sign of tingling or discomfort, before blisters appear. For people who have frequent, painful attacks, the number of outbreaks can be reduced by taking antiviral drugs every day indefinitely (called suppressive therapy). However, taking antiviral drugs does not necessarily prevent infected people from transmitting the infection. Most antiviral drugs are available by prescription only.Penciclovir cream, applied every 2 hours during waking hours, can shorten the healing time and duration of symptoms of a cold sore by about a day. Nonprescription creams containing docosanol (applied 5 times a day) may provide some relief. Acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir taken by mouth for up to a few days may be the most effective treatment for recurring cold sores.Severe HSV infections, including herpes encephalitis and infections in newborns, are treated with acyclovir given intravenously. If the virus becomes resistant to acyclovir, which is very rare, foscarnet can be given intravenously.People with herpes simplex keratitis may be given trifluridine eye drops. An ophthalmologist should supervise treatment.

The antiviral drug valacyclovir can also be taken by mouth.Deep infections that cause a lot of inflammation may require use of corticosteroid drops and drops that dilate the pupil, such as cyclopentolate, atropine or scopolamine.Occasionally, to help speed healing, an ophthalmologist (a medical doctor who specializes in the evaluation and treatmentsurgical and nonsurgicalof eye disorders) gently swabs the cornea with a soft cotton-tipped applicator to remove infected and damaged cells.  Herpes simplex encephalitis is a rare neurological condition that is characterized by inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). People affected by this condition may experience a headache and fever for up to 5 days, followed by personality and behavioral changes; seizures ; hallucinations; and altered levels of consciousness. Without early diagnosis and treatment, severe brain damage or even death may occur. Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by a virus called the herpes simplex virus. Most cases are associated with herpes simplex virus type I (the cause of cold sores or fever blisters), although rare cases can be caused by herpes simplex virus type II (genital herpes). It is poorly understood why some people who are infected with herpes simplex virus develop herpes simplex encephalitis while others do not. Changes ( mutations ) in genes such as TLR3 and TRAF3 have been observed suggesting there may be a genetic component in some cases. Treatment consists of antiviral therapy.[1][2] ",

It may be soft or loud, high pitched or low pitched. You might hear it in either one or both ears. Millions of Americans have tinnitus. People with severe tinnitus may have trouble hearing, working or even sleeping. Causes of tinnitus include Hearing loss in older people Exposure to loud noises Ear and sinus infections Heart or blood vessel problems Meniere's disease Brain tumors Hormonal changes in women Thyroid problems Certain medicines Treatment depends on the cause. Treatments may include hearing aids, sound-masking devices, medicines, and ways to learn how to cope with the noise. NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders  The following tests may be done: Audiometry to test hearing loss Head CT scan Head MRI scan Blood vessel studies (angiography) TREATMENTFixing the problem, if it can be found, may make your symptoms go away. (For example, your provider may remove ear wax.) If TMJ is the cause, your dentist may suggest dental appliances or home exercises to treat teeth clenching and grinding.Talk to your provider about all your current medicines to see if a drug may be causing the problem. This may include over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. Do not stop taking any medicine without talking to your provider.Many medicines are used to relieve symptoms of tinnitus, but no drug works for everyone. Your provider may have you try different medicines or combinations of medicines to see what works for you.A tinnitus masker worn like a hearing aid helps some people. It delivers low-level sound directly into the ear to cover the ear noise. A hearing aid may help reduce ear noise and make outside sounds louder.Counseling may help you learn to live with tinnitus. Your provider may suggest biofeedback training to help with stress.Some people have tried alternative therapies to treat tinnitus. These methods have not been proven, so talk to your provider before trying them.Tinnitus can be managed. Talk with your provider about a management plan that works for you. The American Tinnitus Association offers a good resource center and support group.  Tinnitus can be masked by other sounds: - Low-level music, ticking clocks, or other noises may help you not notice the tinnitus. - Tinnitus is often more noticeable when you go to bed at night because your surroundings are quieter. Any noise in the room, like a humidifier, white noise machine, or dishwasher, can help mask tinnitus and make it less irritating. Learn ways to relax. Stress does not cause tinnitus, but feeling stressed or anxious can worsen it. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and smoking. Get enough rest. Try sleeping with your head propped up in an elevated position. This lessens head congestion and may make noises less noticeable. Protect your ears and hearing from further damage. Avoid loud places and sounds. Use earplugs if you need them. To prevent tinnitus, wear ear protection when ear damage is possible (such as when you are at loud concerts or around jackhammers). If you have hearing loss, stay away from very loud noises to protect your hearing. ",

Although less than 10 percent of people with diabetes feel symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, about 25 percent of people with diabetes have some nerve compression at the wrist.2Other focal neuropathies and proximal neuropathy are less common.  Your symptoms depend on which type of diabetic neuropathy you have. In peripheral neuropathy, some people may have a loss of sensation in their feet, while others may have burning or shooting pain in their lower legs. Most nerve damage develops over many years, and some people may not notice symptoms of mild nerve damage for a long time. In some people, severe pain begins suddenly.  Diabetic neuropathy is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by diabetes or poor blood sugar control. The most common types of diabetic neuropathy result in problems with sensation in the feet. It can develop slowly after many years of diabetes or may occur early in the disease. The symptoms are numbness, pain, or tingling in the feet or lower legs. The pain can be intense and require treatment to relieve the discomfort. The loss of sensation in the feet may also increase the possibility that foot injuries will go unnoticed and develop into ulcers or lesions that become infected. In some cases, diabetic neuropathy can be associated with difficulty walking and some weakness in the foot muscles. There are other types of diabetic-related neuropathies that affect specific parts of the body. For example, diabetic amyotrophy causes pain, weakness and wasting of the thigh muscles, or cranial nerve infarcts that may result in double vision, a drooping eyelid, or dizziness. Diabetes can also affect the autonomic nerves that control blood pressure, the digestive tract, bladder function, and sexual organs. Problems with the autonomic nerves may cause lightheadedness, indigestion, diarrhea or constipation, difficulty with bladder control, and impotence.  Peripheral neuropathy can cause foot problems that lead to blisters and sores. If peripheral neuropathy causes you to lose feeling in your feet, you may not notice pressure or injuries that lead to blisters and sores. Diabetes can make these wounds difficult to heal and increase the chance of infections. These sores and infections can lead to the loss of a toe, foot, or part of your leg. Finding and treating foot problems early can lower the chances that you will develop serious infections.This type of diabetes-related nerve damage can also cause changes to the shape of your feet and toes. A rare condition that can occur in some people with diabetes is Charcot's foot, a problem in which the bones and tissue in your foot are damaged.Peripheral neuropathy can make you more likely to lose your balance and fall, which can increase your chance of fractures and other injuries.

            "knowledge": "Summary : Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of organs and structures inside the body. How the Test is Performed : An ultrasound machine makes images so that organs inside the body can be examined. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves, which reflect off body structures. A computer receives the waves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with an x-ray or CT scan, this test does not use ionizing radiation. The test is done in the ultrasound or radiology department. - You will lie down for the test. - A clear, water-based gel is applied to the skin on the area to be examined. The gel helps with the transmission of the sound waves. - A handheld probe called a transducer is moved over the area being examined. You may need to change position so that other areas can be examined. How to Prepare for the Test : Your preparation will depend on the part of the body being examined. How the Test Will Feel : Most of the time, ultrasound procedures do not cause discomfort. The conducting gel may feel a little cold and wet. Why the Test is Performed : The reason for the test will depend on your symptoms. Normal Results : Results are considered normal if the organs and structures being examined look ok. What Abnormal Results Mean : The meaning of abnormal results will depend on the part of the body being examined and the problem found. Talk to your health care provider about your questions and concerns. Risks : There are no known risks. The test does not use ionizing radiation. Considerations : Some types of ultrasound tests need to be done with a probe that is inserted into your body. Talk to your provider about how your test will be done.

Any vibration on your face, even from talking, can set it off. The condition may come and go, disappearing for days or even months. But the longer you have it, the less often it goes away. TN usually affects people over 50, especially women. The cause is probably a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve, one of the largest nerves in the head. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases the cause is unknown. There is no single test to diagnose TN. It can be hard to diagnose, since many other conditions can cause facial pain. Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary techniques. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also called tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition that causes extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like face pain. The painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. The intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. TN pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. In the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. The intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation. Although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening. The presumed cause of TN is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. TN may be part of the normal aging process but in some cases it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves.  Post-concussion syndrome is when you have symptoms after your concussion.

Most experts do not recommend fasting or following a restricted diet when you have diarrhea.  How doctors treat persistent and chronic diarrhea depends on the cause. Doctors may prescribe antibiotics and medicines that target parasites to treat bacterial or parasitic infections. Doctors may also prescribe medicines to treat some of the conditions that cause chronic diarrhea, such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or ulcerative colitis. How doctors treat chronic diarrhea in children also depends on the cause.Doctors may recommend probiotics.

However, certain bacterial causes of gastroenteritis, particularly <i>Salmonella</i>, <i>Shigella</i>, and <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, can be worsened by antidiarrheal drugs. Doctors typically recommend antidiarrheal drugs only for people with watery diarrhea and no warning signs because such people are unlikely to have such bacterial infections. Eluxadoline is another drug that may be given to some people who have diarrhea caused by IBS.Over-the-counter drugs include adsorbents (for example, kaolin-pectin), which adhere to chemicals, toxins, and infectious organisms.

For example, some people develop fixed drug reactions, in which certain drugs (for example, certain antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and barbiturates) cause localized skin eruptions in the same place every time the drug is taken. This eventually leads to hyperpigmentation of the affected skin.Depending on the drug, chemical, or metal and where it is concentrated in the skin, hyperpigmentation may be violet, bluish black, yellow-brown, or shades of blue, silver, and gray (see also Color Changes in the Skin). In addition to the skin, the teeth, nails, white of the eyes (sclera), and lining of the mouth (mucosa) may be discolored. With many of these drugs, the hyperpigmentation often fades after the drug is stopped, but with some of them, the hyperpigmentation can be permanent.Because many drugs that cause skin pigmentation also cause photosensitivity reactions, people should avoid the sun.  Heavy metal poisoning refers to when excessive exposure to a heavy metal affects the normal function of the body.[1] Examples of heavy metals that can cause toxicity include lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium.[1] Exposure may occur through the diet, from medications, from the environment, or in the course of work or play.[2] Heavy metals can enter the body through the skin, or by inhalation or ingestion.[1] Toxicity can result from sudden, severe exposure, or from chronic exposure over time. Symptoms can vary depending on the metal involved, the amount absorbed, and the age of the person exposed.[2] For example, young children are more susceptible to the effects of lead exposure because they absorb more compared with adults and their brains are still developing.[2] Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are common symptoms of acute metal ingestion. Chronic exposure may cause various symptoms resulting from damage to body organs , and may increase the risk of cancer .[2] Treatment depends on the circumstances of the exposure.

There has not yet been a comprehensive review of outcomes, and large variations in the course of the disease have been reported.[4][5] In the majority of adults, the condition seems to follow a chronic, intermittent course, with no significant mortality risk or severe progression. Diarrhea may resolve with or without treatment, although relapses may occur.[6] In children, a less controllable course has been suspected.[6] However, CG in children seems to follow a generally benign course, with limited long-term morbidity and no increased mortality reported to date.[4] A few reports have documented that the abnormal collagen band in affected people persists (with or without medication) despite symptoms improving.[6]  Because collagenous gastritis is very rare and its cause is unknown, there is currently no established standard therapy for the condition. Various therapies have been attempted with limited success. These have included anti-secretary agents, steroids, iron supplementation, and hypoallergenic diets. Several other therapies have also been tested. A few affected people have shown improvement of symptoms, but no randomized, controlled trials have been performed. More studies are needed to establish a standard treatment strategy.[3]  Collagenous gastritis (CG) is a rare condition that primarily affects the digestive system. People with CG have increased buildup of collagen in the subepithelial layer of the stomach.[1][2] This condition typically affects children and young adults up to 22 years, or older adults over 35 years of age. Signs and symptoms appear to vary depending on the age group. Initial symptoms in children and young adults often include anemia and abdominal pain, whereas older adults often have chronic watery diarrhea associated with collagenous colitis, celiac disease or both.[1][3] Adult collagenous gastritis is also associated with autoimmune diseases such as Sjgren syndrome , lymphocytic gastritis, lymphocytic colitis, and ulcerative colitis.[3] Other signs and symptoms of CG may include nausea and vomiting, weight loss, abdominal distention, and gastrointestinal bleeding.[3] The cause of the condition is unclear.[1] Because of the small number of cases, no standard therapy for CG has been established based on randomized, controlled clinical trials .[3] ",

            "knowledge": "<h2>Summary</h2> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a nervous system disease that attacks nerve cells called neurons in your brain and spinal cord. These neurons transmit messages from your brain and spinal cord to your voluntary muscles - the ones you can control, like in your arms and legs. At first, this causes mild muscle problems. Some people notice Trouble walking or running Trouble writing Speech problems Eventually, you lose your strength and cannot move. When muscles in your chest fail, you cannot breathe. A breathing machine can help, but most people with ALS die from respiratory failure. The disease usually strikes between age 40 and 60. More men than women get it. No one knows what causes ALS. It can run in families, but usually it strikes at random. There is no cure. Medicines can relieve symptoms and, sometimes, prolong survival. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  No cure has yet been found for ALS. However, the drugs riluzole and edaravone have approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat ALS. Riluzole prolongs life by 2-3 months but does not relieve symptoms. Edaravone can slow the clinical decline in daily functioning of people with ALS. The FDA has also approved the NeuRx Diaphragm Pacing System, which uses implanted electrodes and a battery pack to cause the diaphragm (breathing muscle) to contract, to help certain individuals who have ALS before the onset of severe respiratory failure. Other treatments are desig ned to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for people with ALS. Drugs are available to help individuals with spasticity, pain, panic attacks, and depression. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation may help to prevent joint immobility and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Individuals with ALS may eventually consider forms of mechanical ventilation (respirators).  There's no cure for ALS or other motor neuron diseases.Doctors treat your symptoms with: Physical therapy to keep your joints flexible and slow muscle wasting Occupational therapy to prevent choking while eating, or a feeding tube into your stomach if you can no longer swallow Medicines to help with muscle twitches or cramps Medicine to help with emotional outbursts or depression Medicine to help with drooling Medicine for pain A ventilator (breathing machine) if you're too weak to breathe on your own Even with feeding tubes and ventilators, about half of people with ALS die within about 3 years. However, some people live over 10 years and very rarely 30 or more.If you have ALS or one of the other dangerous motor neuron diseases, you may want to make an advance directive. An advance directive is a plan to let your loved ones and doctors know what kinds of medical care you want at the end of your life.  Regardless of the part of the body first affected by the disease, muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disease progresses. Individuals have increasing problems with moving, swallowing, and speaking or forming words. Eventually people with ALS will not be able to stand or walk, get in or out of bed on their own, or use their hands and arms. In later stages of the disease, individuals have difficulty breathing as the muscles of the respiratory system weaken. Although ventilation support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival, it does not affect the progression of ALS. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from the onset of symptoms. However, about 10 percent of those individuals with ALS survive for 10 or more years. ",

It is usually characterized by silvery-blond or straw-colored hair that is disorderly; stands out from the scalp; and cannot be combed flat. It may first become apparent from 3 months of age to 12 years of age.[1] Most cases are isolated, but in some cases it he condition often spontaneously regresses in late childhood.[3] Some published studies suggest that biotin may improve the condition.[4]  Uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) usually resolves on its own (spontaneously) by adolescence.[6] Treatment is usually not necessary.[1] In the cases, where UHS is part of syndrome, the prognosis will depend on the specific syndrome and the signs and symptoms present in the person.  There is no definitive treatment for uncombable hair syndrome , but the condition usually improves or resolves on its own with the onset of puberty. Gentle hair care is generally recommended using conditioners and soft brushes, along with avoiding harsh hair treatments such as permanent waves (perms); chemical relaxants; or excessive brushing and blow drying. These strategies may improve the general manageability of the hair, although how well they work is subjective.[6] Another strategy that has been suggested to improve the appearance of the hair is the use of biotin supplements. One case report suggested significant improvement in hair strength and combability, with an increase in rate of growth after 4 months of supplementation.[6]  The prevalence of uncombable hair syndrome is unknown; at least 100 cases have been described in the scientific literature. There are likely more people who are undiagnosed because adults who seem unaffected may have had uncombable hair syndrome in childhood.  Uncombable hair syndrome is a condition that is characterized by dry, frizzy hair that cannot be combed flat. This condition develops in childhood, often between infancy and age 3, but can appear as late as age 12. Affected children have light-colored hair, described as blond or silvery with a glistening sheen. The hair does not grow downward but out from the scalp in multiple directions. Despite its appearance, the hair is not fragile or brittle, and it grows at a normal or slightly slower rate. Only scalp hair is affected in uncombable hair syndrome.For unknown reasons, this condition usually improves over time. By adolescence individuals with uncombable hair syndrome have hair that lies flat and has normal or nearly normal texture. ",

            "knowledge": "Treatment aims to control symptoms and improve mobility and function. While some people on treatment for SPS may maintain reasonable levels of activity, the majority become increasingly disabled over time. Treatment options depend on the symptoms and severity in each person and may include:[2][3] Benzodiazepines - these are drugs that slow down the nervous system and may relieve muscle spasms and anxiety. They are generally considered the best initial therapy for SPS. Examples include diazepam and clonazepam. Baclofen - this is a muscle relaxant that may be used for people in whom benzodiazepines are not effective or not well-tolerated. Some people benefit from using baclofen in addition to benzodiazepines. Immune modulating therapies - these may be considered in people with severe symptoms who do not experience relief with benzodiazepines and baclofen. Options may include intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy, plasmapheresis (also called plasma exchange), and rituximab. However studies supporting the effectiveness and safety of these therapies for SPS are limited. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are also an important part of management for SPS and may help with side effects of medications (such as weakness) in addition to symptoms of the disease.[3] Management Guidelines Project OrphanAnesthesia is a project whose aim is to create peer-reviewed, readily accessible guidelines for patients with rare diseases and for the anesthesiologists caring for them.

            "knowledge": "Folliculitis is an infection of a hair follicle. It looks like a tiny red or white pimple at the base of a hair. There may be only one infected follicle or many. Each infected follicle is itchy or slightly painful, but the person otherwise does not feel sick.Some people develop folliculitis after exposure to a poorly chlorinated hot tub or whirlpool. This condition, sometimes called hot tub folliculitis or hot tub dermatitis, is caused by the bacterium <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. It begins anytime from 6 hours to 5 days after the exposure. Areas of skin covered by a bathing suit, such as the torso and buttocks, are the most common sites.Some people develop mild folliculitis in areas subjected to moisture and friction, such as areas under sports equipment or on the buttocks.Infected hairs easily fall out or may be plucked out, but new pimples tend to develop.Sometimes stiff hairs in the beard area curl and reenter the skin (ingrown hair) after shaving, causing mild irritation and inflammation. However, there is no actual infection. This type of folliculitis is called pseudofolliculitis barbae.Folliculitis is treated with antibacterial cleansers or antibiotics that are applied directly to the skin (topically). Large areas of folliculitis may require antibiotics taken by mouth. Hot tub folliculitis goes away in a week without any treatment. However, adequate chlorination of the hot tub or whirlpool is necessary to prevent recurrences and to protect others from infection. Folliculitis caused by ingrown hairs is treated by a number of methods with varying success. The person may need to temporarily stop shaving.For severe, recurring folliculitis, doctors may take a bacterial culture (a sample of pus is sent to a laboratory and placed in a culture medium that allows microorganisms to grow). The results of the culture are used to guide the choice of antibiotic.  The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) for people with eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) depends on the type of EPF present (classic, infantile, or immunosuppression-associated). Classic EPF, which occurs mainly in adults, is generally chronic and recurrent but benign. Individual lesions typically last more than 1-2 weeks, and relapse every 3-4 weeks. Except for skin involvement, people with classic EPF are generally in good health with no systemic symptoms. Infantile EPF generally also runs a benign course, and resolves on its own by 3 years of age in over 80% of cases. It is important to recognize that this form is self-limiting so as to avoid unnecessary aggressive treatment in affected infants. Children with this form also generally remain in good health without associated problems, although a possible association with atopy (tendency to develop allergies) has been speculated. The immunosuppression-associated type of EPF is mainly associated with HIV infection, hematological malignancy (blood cancers ), or other cancers, so recognizing that a person has this form of EPF is important. The overall prognosis beyond the skin symptoms largely depends on the prognosis associated with the underlying condition.[7]  Doctors may have you: Wash your body with antibacterial soap Wet a washcloth with warm salt water and apply it to the folliculitis a few times a day Put antibiotic cream on your skin Take antibiotics by mouth, if you have a large area of infected follicles If you regularly get ingrown hairs, doctors may have you: Stop shaving for a while Take antibiotics, if the follicles are infected Hot tub folliculitis will go away on its own. Check and fix the chlorine level of the hot tub to prevent other people from getting folliculitis. ",

            "knowledge": "Abdominal adhesions are diffi cult to prevent; however, certain surgical techniques can minimize abdominal adhesions. Laparoscopic surgery decreases the potential for abdominal adhesions because several tiny incisions are made in the lower abdomen instead of one large incision. The surgeon inserts a laparoscopea thin tube with a tiny video camera attachedinto one of the small incisions. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a video monitor. Patients will usually receive general anesthesia during this surgery. If laparoscopic surgery is not possible and a large abdominal incision is required, at the end of surgery a special fi lmlike material can be inserted between organs or between the organs and the abdominal incision. The fi lmlike material, which looks similar to wax paper and is absorbed by the body in about a week, hydrates organs to help prevent abdominal adhesions. Other steps taken during surgery to reduce abdominal adhesions include - using starch- and latex-free gloves - handling tissues and organs gently - shortening surgery time - using moistened drapes and swabs - occasionally applying saline solution  If abdominal adhesions dont cause symptoms or complications, they typically dont need treatment.If abdominal adhesions cause symptoms or complications, doctors can release the adhesions with laparoscopic or open surgery. However, surgery to treat adhesions may cause new adhesions to form. If you have abdominal adhesions, talk with your doctor about the possible benefits and risks of surgery.If abdominal adhesions cause an intestinal obstruction, you will need treatment at a hospital right away. Doctors will examine you and may order tests to find out if you need emergency surgery. If you do, surgeons will release the adhesions, relieving the intestinal obstruction.If you dont need emergency surgery, doctors may try to treat the obstruction without surgery. Health care professionals will give you intravenous (IV) fluids and insert a tube through your nose and into your stomach to remove the contents of your digestive tract above the obstruction.

The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the duplication and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 22q duplication include developmental delay , intellectual disability , behavioral problems and distinctive facial features. Chromosome testing of both parents can provide more information on whether or not the duplication was inherited . In most cases, parents do not have any chromosomal anomaly. However, sometimes one parent is found to have a balanced translocation , where a piece of a chromosome has broken off and attached to another one with no gain or loss of genetic material. The balanced translocation normally does not cause any signs or symptoms, but it increases the risk for having an affected child with a chromosomal anomaly like a duplication. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.[1] This page is meant to provide general information about 22q duplications.

Lymphedema is the name of a type of swelling. It happens when lymph builds up in your body's soft tissues. Lymph is a fluid that contains white blood cells that defend against germs. It can build up when the lymph system is damaged or blocked. It usually happens in the arms or legs. Causes of lymphedema include - Infection - Cancer - Scar tissue from radiation therapy or surgical removal of lymph nodes - Inherited conditions in which lymph nodes or vessels are absent or abnormal Treatment can help control symptoms. It includes exercise, compression devices, skin care, and massage. NIH: National Cancer Institute ",

            "knowledge": "<h2>Summary</h2> X-rays are a type of radiation called electromagnetic waves. X-ray imaging creates pictures of the inside of your body. The images show the parts of your body in different shades of black and white. This is because different tissues absorb different amounts of radiation. Calcium in bones absorbs x-rays the most, so bones look white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and look gray. Air absorbs the least, so lungs look black. The most familiar use of x-rays is checking for fractures (broken bones), but x-rays are also used in other ways. For example, chest x-rays can spot pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer. When you have an x-ray, you may wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. The amount of radiation you get from an x-ray is small. For example, a chest x-ray gives out a radiation dose similar to the amount of radiation you're naturally exposed to from the environment over 10 days.  The main risk in getting an x-ray is being exposed to radiation. Doctors try to limit the total amount of radiation you get over your lifetime. Getting too much radiation can raise your chance of getting cancer. Most plain x-rays expose you to a very small amount of radiation If youre pregnant or could be pregnant, doctors will shield your belly from the radiation  Hair loss from menopause or childbirth often goes away after 6 months to 2 years. For hair loss due to illness (such as fever), radiation therapy, medicine use, or other causes, no treatment is needed. Hair usually grows back when the illness ends or the therapy is finished. You may want to wear a wig, hat, or other covering until the hair grows back. Hair weaves, hair pieces, or changes of hair style may disguise hair loss. This is generally the least expensive and safest approach to hair loss. Hair pieces should not be sutured (sewn) to the scalp because of the risk of scars and infection. ",

These experiences have occurred most commonly in patients with CNS disorders (e.g., brain lesions or history of seizures) and/or compromised renal function. Close adherence to the recommended dosage regimen is urged, especially in patients with known factors that predispose to convulsive activity. Anticonvulsant therapy should be continued in patients with known seizure disorders. If focal tremors, myoclonus, or seizures occur, patients should be evaluated neurologically, placed on anticonvulsant therapy if not already instituted, and the dosage of ertapenem re-examined to determine whether it should be decreased or discontinued.  <h3>Ertapenem injection may cause side effects.

Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including ertapenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Increasing the dose of valproic acid or divalproex sodium may not be sufficient to overcome this interaction. The concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/divalproex sodium is generally not recommended.

            "knowledge": "Primary familial brain calcification is caused by mutations in one of several genes. The most commonly mutated gene is called SLC20A2, and accounts for an estimated 40 percent of cases, followed by the PDGFRB gene, which is mutated in about 10 percent of cases. Changes in other genes each account for a small percentage of cases. In about half of individuals with primary familial brain calcification the genetic cause is unknown. These individuals are thought to have mutations in genes that have not yet been linked to the condition.  To date, no specific treatment for PFBC is known. Medications can be used to treat symptoms associated with this condition, such as movement disorders, seizures, anxiety, depression, psychosis and urinary incontinence. Off label prescription of biphosphanates have been reported in few patients   The diagnosis of PFBC relies upon:[1] 1) visualization of bilateral (on both sides) calcification of the basal ganglia on neuroimaging, 2) presence of progressive neurological dysfunction, 3) absence of a metabolic, infectious, toxic, or traumatic cause, and 4) a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance (a person must inherit one copy of the altered gene from one parent to have the condition). Molecular genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis.[1] Genetic testing may help to confirm the diagnosis. For individuals in who a diagnosis of PFBC is being considered, other causes of brain calcification should be eliminated prior to pursuing genetic testing, particularly in simplex cases. Testing that might be done includes biochemical analysis of blood and urine, as well as analysis of cerebrospinal fluid. If no other primary cause for brain calcification is detected or if the family history is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance, molecular genetic testing should be considered.[1] Sequencing of SLC20A2 should be pursued first. If no mutation is identified, deletion / duplication analysis of SLC20A2 may be considered. If no identifiable mutation or deletion in SLC20A2 is found, sequence analysis of PDGFRB and PDGFB may be considered.[1] Testing Resources The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides information about the genetic tests for this condition.

Over 30 states in the United States require newborn hearing screenings. Treating hearing loss early can allow many infants to develop normal language skills without delay. In infants born with hearing loss, treatments should start as early as age 6 months.Treatment depends on the baby's overall health and the cause of hearing loss. Treatment may include: Speech therapy Learning sign language Cochlear implant (for those with profound sensorineural hearing loss) Treating the cause of hearing loss may include: Medicines for infections Ear tubes for repeated ear infections Surgery to correct structural problems  Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear. This may be because: The 3 tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) are not conducting sound properly. The eardrum is not vibrating in response to sound. Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. They include: Buildup of wax in the ear canal Damage to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum Fluid remaining in the ear after an ear infection Foreign object that is stuck in the ear canal Hole in the eardrum Scar on the eardrum from repeated infections Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed.Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by: Acoustic neuroma Age-related hearing loss Childhood infections, such as meningitis, mumps, scarlet fever, and measles Mnire' disease Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation) Use of certain medicines Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to: Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures Genetic conditions (more than 400 are known) Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, or herpes The ear can also be injured by: Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum, often from scuba diving Skull fractures (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear) Trauma from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones  Assistive Listening Devices Assistive listening devices devices can help you hear in certain listening environments.

TV listening systems help you listen to the television or the radio without being bothered by other noises around you. Some hearing aids can be plugged into televisions or stereos to help you hear better. Cochlear Implant If your hearing loss is severe and of a certain type, your doctor may suggest that you talk to an otolaryngologist about a cochlear implant. An otolaryngologist is a surgeon who specializes in ear, nose, and throat diseases. A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that the surgeon places under the skin and behind the ear. The device picks up sounds, changes them to electrical signals, and sends them past the non-working part of the inner ear and on to the brain. Hearing through a cochlear implant sounds different from normal hearing, but it lets many people communicate orally in person and over the telephone, and perceive sounds in the environment. ",

That way, if your doctor finds glaucoma, you can start treatment to lower the pressure in your eyes, even if you dont have symptoms yet. Daily treatment will be needed to prevent vision loss.  Glaucoma is an eye disease that causes vision loss. It usually happens when pressure from extra fluid within your eyeball damages the nerve in your eye (optic nerve). Vision loss usually happens slowly, so you may not notice it right away Glaucoma gets worse over time It can cause lasting vision loss and blindness if not treated Special eye drops (prescribed by your doctor) can lower the pressure in your eye Get a full eye exam every 1 to 2 years to detect glaucoma early and help prevent vision loss If you have glaucoma, the doctor will need to check the pressure in your eyes often  Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. While glaucoma can strike anyone, the risk is much greater for people over 60. How Glaucoma Develops There are several different types of glaucoma. Most of these involve the drainage system within the eye. At the front of the eye there is a small space called the anterior chamber. A clear fluid flows through this chamber and bathes and nourishes the nearby tissues. (Watch the video to learn more about glaucoma. To enlarge the video, click the brackets in the lower right-hand corner. To reduce the video, press the Escape (Esc) button on your keyboard.) In glaucoma, for still unknown reasons, the fluid drains too slowly out of the eye. As the fluid builds up, the pressure inside the eye rises. Unless this pressure is controlled, it may cause damage to the optic nerve and other parts of the eye and result in loss of vision. Open-angle Glaucoma The most common type of glaucoma is called open-angle glaucoma. In the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. When fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result. There is no cure for glaucoma. Vision lost from the disease cannot be restored. However, there are treatments that may save remaining vision. That is why early diagnosis is important. See this graphic for a quick overview of glaucoma, including how many people it affects, whos at risk, what to do if you have it, and how to learn more. See a glossary of glaucoma terms. ",

            "knowledge": "Dementia is not a specific disease. It is a descriptive term for a collection of symptoms that can be caused by a number of disorders that affect the brain. People with dementia have significantly impaired intellectual functioning that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They also lose their ability to solve problems and maintain emotional control, and they may experience personality changes and behavioral problems, such as agitation, delusions, and hallucinations. While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia. Doctors diagnose dementia only if two or more brain functions - such as memory and language skills -- are significantly impaired without loss of consciousness. Some of the diseases that can cause symptoms of dementia are Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntingtons disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Doctors have identified other conditions that can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms including reactions to medications, metabolic problems and endocrine abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies, infections, poisoning, brain tumors, anoxia or hypoxia (conditions in which the brains oxygen supply is either reduced or cut off entirely), and heart and lung problems. Although it is common in very elderly individuals, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process.  To diagnose dementia, doctors first assess whether a person has an underlying treatable condition such as depression, abnormal thyroid function, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or vitamin B12 deficiency. Early diagnosis is important, as some causes for symptoms can be treated. In many cases, the specific type of dementia a person has may not be confirmed until after the person has died and the brain is examined.A medical assessment for dementia generally includes:- Patient history. Typical questions about a person's medical and family history might include asking about whether dementia runs in the family, how and when symptoms began, changes in behavior and personality, and if the person is taking certain medications that might cause or worsen symptoms. - Physical exam. Measuring blood pressure and other vital signs may help physicians detect conditions that might cause or occur with dementia. Such conditions may be treatable. - Neurological tests. Assessing balance, sensory function, reflexes, vision, eye movements, and other cognitive functions helps identify conditions that may affect the diagnosis or are treatable with drugs. ",

            "knowledge": "According to many investigators, acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes, one received from the father and one from the mother. In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent. If an individual receives one normal gene and one gene for the disease, the person will be a carrier for the disease but usually will not show symptoms.   When acrocallosal syndrome is caused by KIF7 gene mutations, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.Acrocallosal syndrome (or severe Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome) resulting from GLI3 gene mutations is considered autosomal dominant , which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. This condition results from new (de novo) mutations in the gene that occur during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early embryonic development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. ",

            "knowledge": "Each of your body's cells contains genes. Genes are the instructions that tell each of your cells what to do. Genes tell cells when to grow, when to stop growing, and what substances to make. For example, certain genes tell cells in your stomach to make stomach acid.Sometimes one of your genes can go bad in ways that make a cell turn cancerous. A gene can go bad if: The gene was damaged by something you were exposed to (an environmental factor) The gene was copied incorrectly during normal cell growth Less likely, you inherited a cancer gene from one of your parents. Sometimes people in a family are more likely to have a certain cancer. A cancer-causing gene could run in that family. One cancer-causing gene called <i>BRCA</i> increases the risk of breast cancer.  Not being physically active. Women who are not physically active have a higher risk of getting breast cancer. Being overweight or obese after menopause. Older women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting breast cancer than those at a normal weight. Taking hormones. Some forms of hormone replacement therapy (those that include both estrogen and progesterone) taken during menopause can raise risk for breast cancer when taken for more than five years. Certain oral contraceptives (birth control pills) also have been found to raise breast cancer risk. Reproductive history. Having the first pregnancy after age 30, not breastfeeding, and never having a full-term pregnancy can raise breast cancer risk. Drinking alcohol. Studies show that a woman?s risk for breast cancer increases with the more alcohol she drinks. Research suggests that other factors such as smoking, being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer, and changes in other hormones due to night shift working also may increase breast cancer risk.  Being around certain things can raise your chances of cancer, including: Tobacco smoke: Lung, mouth, throat, esophagus, kidney, and bladder cancers Asbestos (a mineral fiber used for insulation and other building materials): Lung cancer and mesothelioma (cancer in the tissues that line your lungs) Sunlight: Skin cancer X-rays: Leukemia and cancer in the organ exposed to radiation Radon (a radioactive gas that comes from the ground and can build up to harmful levels in basements): Lung cancer Some chemicals used at work (such as benzene, chromates, nickel, certain pesticides, and vinyl chloride) can cause cancer.Geography (where you live) can affect your chances of getting cancer.

Because of these changes, your body's cells don't use insulin well, a condition called insulin resistance. All pregnant women have some insulin resistance during late pregnancy. Most pregnant women can produce enough insulin to overcome insulin resistance, but some cannot. These women develop gestational diabetes.Being overweight or obese is linked to gestational diabetes. Women who are overweight or obese may already have insulin resistance when they become pregnant. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also be a factor.Having a family history of diabetes makes it more likely that a woman will develop gestational diabetes, which suggests that genes play a role.

This cry may be heard immediately after birth, lasts several weeks, and then disappears. However, not all affected newborns have this distinct cry. An infant with this syndrome may have a low birth weight and a small head with many abnormal features, including a round face, small jaw, wide nose, widely separated eyes, crossed eyes (strabismus), and abnormally shaped ears set low in the head. Often the infant seems limp. Webbed fingers and toes (syndactyly) and heart defects are common. There are significant limitations in mental and physical development. Many children with cri du chat syndrome survive to adulthood but have substantial disabilities.  Most cases of cri-du-chat syndrome are not inherited. The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Affected people typically have no history of the disorder in their family.About 10 percent of people with cri-du-chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with cri-du-chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5, which results in the intellectual disability and health problems characteristic of this disorder.  Cri du chat syndrome is rare. It is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 5.Most cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child. ",

Don't move the elbow unless you're instructed to do so. Ice your elbow for 15 to 20 minutes at a time, 3 to 4 times a day. Wrap the ice in cloth. DO NOT place ice directly on the skin. Cold from the ice can damage your skin. Compress the area by wrapping it with an elastic bandage or compression wrap. Elevate your elbow by raising it above the level of your heart. You can prop it up with pillows. You can take ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) to reduce pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) helps with pain, but not swelling. You can buy these pain medicines at the store. Talk with your provider before using these medicines if you have heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or have had stomach ulcers or internal bleeding in the past. DO NOT take more than the amount recommended on the bottle or by your provider.  Elbow pain can be caused by many problems. A common cause in adults is tendinitis. This is inflammation and injury to the tendons, which are soft tissues that attach muscle to bone.People who play racquet sports are most likely to injure the tendons on the outside of the elbow. This condition is commonly called tennis elbow. Golfers are more likely to injure the tendons on the inside of the elbow.Other common causes of elbow tendinitis are gardening, playing baseball, using a screwdriver, or overusing your wrist and arm.Young children commonly develop \"nursemaid elbow,\" which often occurs when someone is pulling on their straightened arm. The bones are stretched apart momentarily and a ligament slips in between. It becomes trapped when the bones try to snap back into place. As a result, the child will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cries out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow. This condition is also called an elbow subluxation (a partial dislocation). This often gets better on its own when the ligament slips back into place. Surgery is usually not needed.Other common causes of elbow pain are: Bursitis -- inflammation of a fluid-filled cushion beneath the skin Arthritis -- narrowing of the joint space and loss of cartilage in the elbow Elbow strains Infection of the elbow Tendon tears -- biceps rupture  Your provider will examine you and carefully check your elbow. You will be asked about your medical history and symptoms such as: Are both elbows affected? Does the pain shift from the elbow to other joints? Is the pain over the outside bony prominence of the elbow? Did the pain begin suddenly and severely? Did the pain begin slowly and mildly and then get worse? Is the pain getting better on its own? Did the pain begin after an injury? What makes the pain better or worse? Is there pain that goes from the elbow down to the hand? Treatment depends on the cause, but may involve: Antibiotics Corticosteroid shots Manipulation Pain medicine Physical therapy Surgery (last resort)  Call your provider if: You have a prolonged case of tendinitis that doesn't improve with home care. The pain is due to a direct elbow injury. There is obvious deformity. You can't use the elbow. You have fever or swelling and redness of your elbow. Your elbow is locked and can't straighten or bend.

            "knowledge": "There is no cure for Angelman syndrome. Treatment helps to manage health and development problems caused by the condition. Anticonvulsant medicines help control seizures Behavior therapy helps manage hyperactivity, sleep problems, and development problems Occupational and speech therapy manage speech problems and teach living skills Physical therapy helps with walking and movement problems  Angelman syndrome (AS) is a genetic condition that causes problems with the way a child's body and brain develop. The syndrome is present from birth (congenital). However, it often isn't diagnosed until about 6 to 12 months of age. This is when development problems are first noticed in most cases.  Most individuals with Angelman syndrome will have severe developmental delays, speech limitations, and motor difficulties. However, individuals with Angelman syndrome can have normal life spans and generally do not show developmental regression as they age. Early diagnosis and tailored interventions and therapies help improve quality of life.  Many of the characteristic features of Angelman syndrome result from the loss of function of a gene called UBE3A. People normally inherit one copy of the UBE3A gene from each parent. Both copies of this gene are turned on (active) in many of the body's tissues. In certain areas of the brain, however, only the copy inherited from a person's mother (the maternal copy) is active. This parent-specific gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. If the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene is lost because of a chromosomal change or a gene mutation, a person will have no active copies of the gene in some parts of the brain.Several different genetic mechanisms can inactivate or delete the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Most cases of Angelman syndrome (about 70 percent) occur when a segment of the maternal chromosome 15 containing this gene is deleted. In other cases (about 11 percent), Angelman syndrome is caused by a mutation in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene.In a small percentage of cases, Angelman syndrome results when a person inherits two copies of chromosome 15 from his or her father (paternal copies) instead of one copy from each parent. This phenomenon is called paternal uniparental disomy. Rarely, Angelman syndrome can also be caused by a chromosomal rearrangement called a translocation, or by a mutation or other defect in the region of DNA that controls activation of the UBE3A gene. These genetic changes can abnormally turn off (inactivate) UBE3A or other genes on the maternal copy of chromosome 15.The causes of Angelman syndrome are unknown in 10 to 15 percent of affected individuals. Changes involving other genes or chromosomes may be responsible for the disorder in these cases.In some people who have Angelman syndrome, the loss of a gene called OCA2 is associated with light-colored hair and fair skin. The OCA2 gene is located on the segment of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in people with this disorder. However, loss of the OCA2 gene does not cause the other signs and symptoms of Angelman syndrome. The protein produced from this gene helps determine the coloring (pigmentation) of the skin, hair, and eyes.  Angelman syndrome is a complex genetic disorder that primarily affects the nervous system. Characteristic features of this condition include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and problems with movement and balance (ataxia). Most affected children also have recurrent seizures (epilepsy) and a small head size (microcephaly). Delayed development becomes noticeable by the age of 6 to 12 months, and other common signs and symptoms usually appear in early childhood.Children with Angelman syndrome typically have a happy, excitable demeanor with frequent smiling, laughter, and hand-flapping movements. Hyperactivity, a short attention span, and a fascination with water are common. Most affected children also have difficulty sleeping and need less sleep than usual.With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less excitable, and the sleeping problems tend to improve. However, affected individuals continue to have intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and seizures throughout their lives. Adults with Angelman syndrome have distinctive facial features that may be described as \"coarse.\" Other common features include unusually fair skin with light-colored hair and an abnormal side-to-side curvature of the spine (scoliosis). The life expectancy of people with this condition appears to be nearly normal. ",

Scabies can easily infect sex partners and other household members. Sharing clothes, towels, and bedding can sometimes spread scabies. This can happen much more easily when the infested person has crusted scabies. You cannot get scabies from a pet. Pets get a different mite infection called mange. Symptoms are - Pimple-like irritations or a rash - Intense itching, especially at night - Sores caused by scratching Your health care provider diagnoses scabies by looking at the skin rash and finding burrows in the skin. Several lotions are available to treat scabies. The infected person's clothes, bedding and towels should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. Treatment is also recommended for household members and sexual partners. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Crusted scabies may be particularly difficult to treat. Patients with crusted scabies may be instructed by their doctors to remove scaling skin so that topical medications can penetrate the skin more easily.[3] Repeated applications of a topical medication or combined treatment with a topical and an oral medication for several weeks or longer may be necessary.[3][4] Patients who still have signs of infection after one month may need additional treatment. Infants and pregnant women should be treated for scabies only if the benefit is determined to outweigh the risk and if the diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy .[3] A dermatologist or infectious disease physician should be involved in the care of the patient and those with whom they have had close contact. Treatment of crusted scabies should be done in an inpatient or residential setting, with the patient in a private room.Treatment includes oral Ivermectin and topical insecticides.  Crusted scabies (also called Norwegian scabies) is an infestation characterized by thick crusts of skin that contain large numbers of scabies mites and eggs. It is a severe form of scabies that occurs most often in people who have a weakened immune system or a neurological disease, the elderly, and the disabled. The symptoms of the more common form of scabies, such as itching and a rash, may be absent. Crusted scabies is very contagious and can spread both by direct skin-to-skin contact and through contaminated items such as clothing, bedding, and furniture.[1][2] It is caused by super-infestation with Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis, a mite that can only reproduce on humans. People with crusted scabies should receive quick and aggressive medical treatment for their infestation to prevent future outbreaks of scabies.[1] Ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic infections, is commonly used for treatment.[2]  Scabies is an itchy rash.

Common symptoms include difficulty seeing at night and a loss of side (peripheral)¬†vision. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptors and other cell¬†types  Available treatments aim to slow the progression of the disease and primarily include light avoidance and the use of low-vision aids. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option. However, taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease appear to be relatively weak.[4] Studies have explored potential treatment with DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid naturally found in fish. While DHA is known to play a structural role in retinal cells , more research is needed to determine whether supplements should be recommended.[2] Current research is focused on the development of new treatments including gene therapy , retinal transplantation, and the use of a retinal prosthesis. Stem cell transplantation would involve the injection and integration of stem cells into the retina, in hopes these cells will replace dead cells and provide the missing enzymes and chemicals needed for sight. Gene therapy could potentially be used when the disease-causing mutation is known and would aim to restore production of the missing or abnormal protein . Studies with retinal prosthetics have tested devices that transform light into electrical signals that can be sent directly to the inner retina and brain, avoiding the diseased part of the outer retina. Though challenges remain, preliminary research into these technologies has been promising.[2][3] FDA-Approved Treatments The medication(s) listed below have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as orphan products for treatment of this condition. Learn more orphan products. National Library of Medicine Drug Information Portal  Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited eye diseases that affect the light-sensitive part of the eye (retina). RP causes cells in the retina to die, causing progressive vision loss. The first sign of RP usually is night blindness. As the condition progresses, affected individuals develop tunnel vision (loss of peripheral vision), and eventually loss of central vision. RP may be caused by mutations in any of at least 50 genes . Inheritance can be autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , or X-linked .[1] Treatment options to slow the progression of vision loss include light avoidance, use of low-vision aids, and vitamin A supplementation. Researchers are working to develop new treatment options for the future such as gene therapy , stem cell transplantation and prosthetic implants.[2][3]  Vitamin A palmitate Omega-3 fatty acid supplements Lutein plus zeaxanthin supplements Sometimes, drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors Sometimes, surgically implanted computer chips No treatment can reverse the damage caused by retinitis pigmentosa. Vitamin A palmitate may help slow the progression of the disorder in some people. Supplements with an omega-3 fatty acid (for example, docosahexaenoic acid) and a combination of lutein plus zeaxanthin may also slow the rate of vision loss. People who have swelling of the retina (macular edema), drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (usually acetazolamide or dorzolamide) are given by mouth or as eye drops.A new gene-therapy drug called voretigene neparovovec-ryzl may restore some vision to people with a particular mutation, provided they still have some retinal cells capable of surviving and reproducing.People who have lost all vision or almost all vision can be given a surgically implanted computer chip in the eye, which can restore some perception of light and shapes.

Heat will relax the muscle when the spasm begins, but ice may be helpful when the pain has improved. If the muscle is still sore, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can help with pain. If the muscle cramps are severe, your health care provider can prescribe other medicines. The most common cause of muscle cramps during sports activity is not getting enough fluids. Often, drinking water will ease the cramping. However, water alone does not always help. Salt tablets or sports drinks, which also replenish lost minerals, can be helpful. Other tips for relieving muscle cramps: - Change your workouts so that you are exercising within your ability. - Drink plenty of fluids while exercising and increase your potassium intake (orange juice and bananas are great sources of potassium). - Stretch to improve flexibility.  Leg cramps are common. The most common causes are benign leg cramps and exercise-associated cramping. Stretching and not consuming caffeine can help prevent muscle cramps. Drug therapy is not usually recommended to prevent muscle cramps.

These spasms usually last much longer than muscle cramps and are more widespread. The muscles may also twitch.<b>Illusory muscle cramps</b> occur in some people. These people feel as if they are having cramps but no muscle contraction occurs.<b>Hardening of the arteries in the legs</b> (peripheral arterial disease) may cause calf pain (claudication) during physical activity such as walking.

            "knowledge": "A Bartholin abscess forms when a small opening (duct) from the gland gets blocked. Fluid in the gland builds up and may become infected. Fluid may build up over many years before an abscess occurs.Often the abscess appears quickly over several days. The area will become very hot and swollen. Activity that puts pressure on the vulva, and walking and sitting, may cause severe pain.  Bartholin abscess is the buildup of pus that forms a lump (swelling) in one of the Bartholin glands. These glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening.  SELF-CARE STEPSSoaking in warm water 4 times a day for several days can ease the discomfort. It can also help the abscess open and drain on its own. However, the opening is often very small and closes quickly. Therefore, the abscess often returns.DRAINAGE OF THE ABSCESSA small surgical cut can completely drain the abscess. This relieves symptoms and provides the fastest recovery. The procedure can be done under local anesthesia in a provider's office. A 1 to 2 cm cut is made at the site of abscess. The cavity is irrigated with normal saline. A catheter (tube) may be inserted and left in place for 4 to 6 weeks. This allows continuous drainage while the area heals. Sutures are not required. You should begin soaking in warm water 1 to 2 days afterward. You cannot have sexual intercourse until the catheter is removed. You may be asked to have antibiotics if there is pus or other signs of infection.MARSUPIALIZATIONWomen can also be treated with a minor surgery called marsupialization. The procedure involves creating an elliptical opening along the cyst to help the gland drain. The abscess is removed. The provider places stitches at the edges of the cyst. The procedure can sometimes be done in the clinic with medicine to numb the area. In other cases, it may need to be done in the hospital with general anesthesia so that you are asleep and pain-free. You should begin soaking in warm water 1 to 2 days afterward. You cannot have sexual intercourse for 4 weeks after surgery. You can use oral pain medicines after the procedure. Your provider may prescribe narcotic pain medicines if you need them. Your provider may recommend that the glands be completely removed if abscesses keep coming back.  The problem rarely goes away on its own. Antibiotics alone usually cannot treat an abscess.Treatment involves surgery to open and drain the abscess. Surgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with medicine to make you sleepy. Sometimes, spinal or general anesthesia is used. Surgery is most often an outpatient procedure, which means that you go home on the same day. The surgeon cuts open the abscess and drains the pus. Sometimes a drain is put in to keep the incision open and draining, and sometimes the abscess cavity is packed with gauze. If the pus collection is deep, you may need to stay in the hospital longer for pain control and nursing care of the abscess drainage site. After surgery, you may need warm sitz baths (sitting in a tub of warm water). This helps relieve pain and reduce swelling. Drained abscesses are usually left open and no stitches are needed.The surgeon may prescribe painkillers and antibiotics.You may need stool softeners. Practice good hygiene. Eat soft or liquid foods until the abscess has healed.Avoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help.  The chance of a full recovery is excellent. The abscesses may return in few cases.It is important to treat any vaginal infection that is diagnosed at the same time as the abscess. ",

This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube with a small camera on the end of it. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth and down the esophagus, which leads to the stomach.After the endoscopy tube is inserted, the skin over the left side of belly (abdomen) area is cleaned and numbed. The doctor makes a small surgical cut in this area. The G-tube is inserted through this cut into the stomach. The tube is small, flexible, and hollow. The doctor uses stitches to close the stomach around the tube.  Stitches are special threads that are sewn through the skin at an injury site to bring a wound together. Care for your stitches and wound as follows: Keep the area clean and dry for the first 24 to 48 hours after stitches have been placed. Then, you can start to gently wash around the site 1 to 2 times daily. Wash with cool water and soap. Clean as close to the stitches as you can. Do not wash or rub the stitches directly. Dab the site dry with a clean paper towel. Do not rub the area. Avoid using the towel directly on the stitches. If there was a bandage over the stitches, replace it with a new clean bandage and antibiotic treatment, if instructed to do so.

            "knowledge": "Trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also called tic douloureux, is a chronic pain condition that causes extreme, sporadic, sudden burning or shock-like face pain. The painseldomlasts more than a few seconds or a minute or twoper episode. The intensity of pain can be physically and mentally incapacitating. TN pain is typically felt on one side of the jaw or cheek. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months at a time and then disappear for months or years. In the days before an episode begins, some patients may experience a tingling or numbing sensation or a somewhat constant and aching pain. The attacks often worsen over time, with fewer and shorter pain-free periods before they recur. The intense flashes of pain can be triggered by vibration or contact with the cheek (such as when shaving, washing the face, or applying makeup), brushing teeth, eating, drinking, talking, or being exposed to the wind. TN occurs most often in people over age 50, but it can occur at any age, and is more common in women than in men. There is some evidence that the disorder runs in families, perhaps because of an inherited pattern of blood vessel formation. Although sometimes debilitating, the disorder is not life-threatening. The presumed cause of TN is a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve in the head as it exits the brainstem. TN may be part of the normal aging process but in some cases it is the associated with another disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or other disorders characterized by damage to the myelin sheath that covers certain nerves.  Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a type of chronic pain that affects your face. It causes extreme, sudden burning or shock-like pain. It usually affects one side of the face. Any vibration on your face, even from talking, can set it off. The condition may come and go, disappearing for days or even months. But the longer you have it, the less often it goes away. TN usually affects people over 50, especially women. The cause is probably a blood vessel pressing on the trigeminal nerve, one of the largest nerves in the head. Tumors and multiple sclerosis can also cause TN, but in some cases the cause is unknown. There is no single test to diagnose TN. It can be hard to diagnose, since many other conditions can cause facial pain. Treatment options include medicines, surgery, and complementary techniques. NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  The pain of TN comes from the trigeminal nerve. This nerve carries the sensations of touch and pain from the face, eyes, sinuses, and mouth to the brain.Trigeminal neuralgia may be caused by: Multiple sclerosis (MS) or other diseases that damage the protective covering myelin of the nerves Pressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel or tumor Injury to the trigeminal nerve, such as from trauma to the face or from oral or sinus surgery Often, no exact cause is found. TN usually affects adults above age 50 years, but it can occur at any age. Women are affected more often than men. When TN affects people younger than 40, it is often due to MS or a tumor. ",

            "knowledge": "If untreated, hypothyroidism can eventually cause anemia, a low body temperature, and heart failure. This situation may progress to confusion, stupor, or coma (myxedema coma). Myxedema coma is a life-threatening complication in which breathing slows, seizures occur, and blood flow to the brain decreases. Myxedema coma can be triggered in a person with hypothyroidism by physical stresses, such as exposure to the cold, as well as by an infection, injury, surgery, and drugs such as sedatives that depress brain function.Spotlight on Aging: Hypothyroidism in Older People Many older people have some degree of hypothyroidism. About 10% of women and 6% of men are affected. Typical symptoms, such as weight gain, muscle cramps, tingling of the hands, and the inability to tolerate cold, are less common among older people. When such symptoms do occur among older people, they are less obvious. Older people may also have less typical symptoms. For example, they may lose weight, become confused, and have a decreased appetite, joint stiffness, joint and muscle pains, weakness, and a tendency to fall. Because symptoms in older people can be different, are often subtle and vague, and are common among older people who do not have hypothyroidism, doctors may not recognize these symptoms as being caused by hypothyroidism. A screening test, in which blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone are measured, is important. The test should be done at age 65 even if people have no symptoms of hypothyroidism.  Experts recommend that people eat a balanced diet to obtain most nutrients. More information about diet and nutrition can be found on the National Agricultural Library website at www.nutrition.gov. Dietary Supplements Iodine is an essential mineral for the thyroid. However, people with autoimmune thyroid disease may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Taking iodine drops or eating foods containing large amounts of iodinesuch as seaweed, dulse, or kelpmay cause or worsen hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. More information about iodine can be found in the National Library of Medicine fact sheet Iodine in diet, available at www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002421.htm. Women need more iodine when they are pregnantabout 250 micrograms a day because the baby gets iodine from the mothers diet. In the United States, about 7 percent of pregnant women may not get enough iodine in their diet or through prenatal vitamins.3 Choosing iodized salt salt supplemented with iodineover plain salt and prenatal vitamins containing iodine will ensure this need is met. To help ensure coordinated and safe care, people should discuss their use of dietary supplements, such as iodine, with their health care provider. Tips for talking with health care providers are available through the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

Follow your provider's advice if blistered areas become crusted or raw. You might need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas. Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or dressing, and if so, what type to use. You may need to use oral steroid medicines for short periods of time if you have swallowing problems. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection in the mouth or throat. Take good care of your oral health and get regular dental check-ups. It is best to see a dentist who has experience treating people with EB. Eat a healthy diet. When you have a lot of skin injury, you may need extra calories and protein to help your skin heal.

Protein and gene therapy and the use of the drug interferon are being studied.  Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of disorders in which skin blisters form after a minor injury. It is passed down in families.  Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is one of the major forms of epidermolysis bullosa, a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Blisters and skin erosions form in response to minor injury or friction, such as rubbing or scratching. Researchers classify junctional epidermolysis bullosa into two main types: Herlitz JEB and non-Herlitz JEB. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly, and they can be caused by mutations in the same genes. Herlitz JEB is the more severe form of the condition. From birth or early infancy, affected individuals have blistering over large regions of the body. Blistering also affects the mucous membranes, such as the moist lining of the mouth and digestive tract, which can make it difficult to eat and digest food. As a result, many affected children have chronic malnutrition and slow growth. The extensive blistering leads to scarring and the formation of red, bumpy patches called granulation tissue. Granulation tissue bleeds easily and profusely, making affected infants susceptible to serious infections and loss of necessary proteins, minerals, and fluids. Additionally, a buildup of granulation tissue in the airway can lead to a weak, hoarse cry and difficulty breathing. Other complications of Herlitz JEB can include fusion of the fingers and toes, abnormalities of the fingernails and toenails, joint deformities (contractures) that restrict movement, and hair loss (alopecia). Because the signs and symptoms of Herlitz JEB are so severe, infants with this condition usually do not survive beyond the first year of life. The milder form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa is called non-Herlitz JEB. The blistering associated with non-Herlitz JEB may be limited to the hands, feet, knees, and elbows, and it often improves after the newborn period. Other characteristic features of this condition include alopecia, malformed fingernails and toenails, and irregular tooth enamel. Most affected individuals do not have extensive scarring or granulation tissue formation, so breathing difficulties and other severe complications are rare. Non-Herlitz JEB is typically associated with a normal lifespan. ",

When an abdominal aortic aneurysm begins to tear or ruptures, it is a medical emergency. Only about 1 in 5 people survive a ruptured abdominal aneurysm.  The aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to the abdomen, pelvis, and legs. An abdominal aortic aneurysm occurs when an area of the aorta becomes very large or balloons out.  Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are aneurysms that occur in the part of the aorta that passes through the abdomen. They may occur at any age, but are most common in men between 50 and 80 years of age. Many people with an AAA have no symptoms, but some people have a pulsing sensation in the abdomen and/or pain in the back.[1] If the aneurysm ruptures, it may cause deep, severe pain; nausea; vomiting; fast heart rate; clammy skin; and/or shock.[1][2] About 20% of AAAs eventually rupture and are often fatal.[1] The condition has multiple genetic and environmental risk factors , and may sometimes occur as part of an inherited syndrome . When more than one family member is affected, it may be considered \" familial abdominal aortic aneurysm.\"[3] Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and may include blood pressure medications, or surgery to repair the aneurysm.[1]  If you have bleeding inside your body from an aortic aneurysm, you will need surgery right away.If the aneurysm is small and there are no symptoms: Surgery is rarely done. You and your provider must decide if the risk of having surgery is smaller than the risk of bleeding if you do not have surgery. Your provider may want to check the size of the aneurysm with ultrasound tests every 6 months. Most of the time, surgery is done if the aneurysm is bigger than 2 inches (5 centimeters) across or growing quickly. The goal is to do surgery before complications develop.There are two types of surgery: Open repair - A large cut is made in your abdomen. The abnormal vessel is replaced with a graft made of man-made material. Endovascular stent grafting - This procedure can be done without making a large cut in your abdomen, so you may recover more quickly. This may be a safer approach if you have certain other medical problems or are an older adult. Endovascular repair can sometimes be done for a leaking or bleeding aneurysm.  The exact cause of an aneurysm is unknown. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery. Factors that can increase your risk of having this problem include: Smoking High blood pressure Male gender Genetic factors An abdominal aortic aneurysm is most often seen in males over age 60 who have one or more risk factors. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or tear. This can be life threatening.  The aorta is the main blood vessel (artery) that carries blood away from your heart to the rest of your body. An aneurysm is a bulge in an artery wall. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the part of your aorta that passes through your belly. Aneurysms may cause a pulsing feeling in your belly Aneurysms that are large or are growing need surgery to prevent them from bursting If the aneurysm bursts, blood flows out and you have severe pain and low blood pressure If the aneurysm bursts, you'll die if you don't have surgery Doctors often find an aneurysm during a regular exam or from an imaging test (such as an x-ray or CT scan) taken for another problem and found by accident You're more likely to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm if: You're a man You're between the ages of 50 and 80 Someone in your family had one You have high blood pressure You smoke ",

This is a medical doctor who specializes in eye diseases and eye surgery.Adults are usually awake for the procedure. Numbing medicine (local anesthesia) is given using eyedrops or a shot. This blocks pain. You will also get medicine to help you relax. Children usually receive general anesthesia. This is medicine that puts them into a deep sleep so that they are unable to feel pain.The doctor uses a special microscope to view the eye. A small cut (incision) is made in the eye.The lens is removed in one of the following ways, depending on the type of cataract: Phacoemulsification: With this procedure, the doctor uses a tool that produces sound waves to break up the cataract into small pieces. The pieces are then suctioned out. This procedure uses a very small incision. Extracapsular extraction: The doctor uses a small tool to remove the cataract in mostly one piece. This procedure uses a larger incision. Laser surgery: The doctor guides a machine that uses laser energy to make the incisions and soften the cataract. The rest of the surgery is much like phacoemulsification. Using the laser instead of a knife (scalpel) may speed recovery and be more accurate. After the cataract is removed, a manmade lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL), is usually placed into the eye to restore the focusing power of the old lens (cataract). It helps improve your vision.The doctor may close the incision with very small stitches. Usually, a self-sealing (sutureless) method is used. If you have stitches, they may need to be removed later.The surgery lasts less than half an hour. Most times, just one eye is done. If you have cataracts in both eyes, your doctor may suggest waiting at least 1 to 2 weeks between each surgery.  Most people do well and recover quickly after cataract surgery.If a person has other eye problems, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration, the surgery may be more difficult or the outcome may not be as good.  Before you go home, you may receive the following: A patch to wear over your eye until the follow-up exam Eyedrops to prevent infection, treat inflammation, and help with healing You will need to have someone drive you home after surgery. You will usually have a follow-up exam with your doctor the next day. If you had stitches, you will need to make an appointment to have them removed.Tips for recovering after cataract surgery: Wear dark sunglasses outside after you remove the patch. Wash your hands well before and after using eyedrops and touching your eye. Try not to get soap and water in your eye when you are bathing or showering for the first few days. Light activities are best as you recover. Check with your doctor before doing any strenuous activity, resuming sexual activity, or driving. Recovery takes about 2 weeks. If you need new glasses or contact lenses, you can usually have them fitted at that time. Keep your follow-up visit with your doctor. ",

            "knowledge": "Symptoms of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome often include profound intellectual disability. Children may also have epilepsy, a broad or beaked nose, scalp defects, drooping upper eyelids (ptosis) and gaps or fissures (colobomas) of the iris, cleft palate, and delayed bone development. Boys may have undescended testes (cryptorchidism) and a misplaced opening of the urethra (hypospadias). Some children have an immune deficiency, which means their body is less able to fight off infections. Many affected children die during infancy.  The long-term outlook ( prognosis ) for people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS) depends on the specific features present and the severity of those features. The average life expectancy is unknown. Muscle weakness may increase the risk of having chest infections and ultimately may reduce the life expectancy. Many people, in the absence of severe heart defects, chest infections, and uncontrollable seizures , survive into adulthood.[3][4]  Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. The major features of this disorder include a characteristic facial appearance, delayed growth and development, intellectual disability, and seizures. Almost everyone with this disorder has distinctive facial features, including a broad, flat nasal bridge and a high forehead. This combination is described as a \"Greek warrior helmet\" appearance. The eyes are widely spaced and may be protruding. Other characteristic facial features include a shortened distance between the nose and upper lip (a short philtrum), a downturned mouth, a small chin (micrognathia), and poorly formed ears with small holes (pits) or flaps of skin (tags). Additionally, affected individuals may have asymmetrical facial features and an unusually small head (microcephaly). People with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome experience delayed growth and development. Slow growth begins before birth, and affected infants tend to have problems feeding and gaining weight (failure to thrive). They also have weak muscle tone (hypotonia) and underdeveloped muscles. Motor skills such as sitting, standing, and walking are significantly delayed. Most children and adults with this disorder also have short stature. Intellectual disability ranges from mild to severe in people with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Compared to people with other forms of intellectual disability, their socialization skills are strong, while verbal communication and language skills tend to be weaker. Most affected children also have seizures, which may be resistant to treatment. Seizures tend to disappear with age. Additional features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome include skin changes such as mottled or dry skin, skeletal abnormalities such as abnormal curvature of the spine (scoliosis and kyphosis), dental problems including missing teeth, and an opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) and/or in the lip (cleft lip). Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome can also cause abnormalities of the eyes, heart, genitourinary tract, and brain. A condition called Pitt-Rogers-Danks syndrome has features that overlap with those of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. Researchers now recognize that these two conditions are actually part of a single syndrome with variable signs and symptoms. ",

            "knowledge": "Bell's palsy is a form of temporary facial paralysis which results from damage or trauma to one of the facial nerves. This disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of facial paralysis that often affects just one side and can cause significant facial distortion. Symptoms vary, but may include twitching, weakness, drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in the eye. While the exact cause is unknown, many researchers believe that a virus may lead to swelling of the 7th cranial nerve. Steroids, such as prednisone, may reduce the inflammation and swelling. Other medications used to treat Bell's palsy include acyclovir (to fight viral infections) and aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (to relieve pain). Physical therapy, facial massage and acupuncture have also been used.  Bell palsy is sudden weakness on one side of your face. It happens when a nerve in your face (called the facial nerve) swells and gets squeezed. Bell palsy affects only one side of your face That side of your face becomes weak and droops Treatment usually involves medicine called corticosteroids Most people with Bell palsy get better within several months, even without treatment  Bell's palsy is a disorder of the nerve that controls movement of the muscles in the face. This nerve is called the facial orseventh cranial nerve. Damage to this nerve causes weakness or paralysis of these muscles. Paralysis means that you cannot use the muscles at all.  Often, no treatment is needed. Symptoms often begin to improve right away. But, it may take weeks or even months for the muscles to get stronger.Your provider may give you lubricating eye drops or eye ointments to keep the surface of the eye moist if you can't close it completely. You may need to wear an eye patch while you sleep.Sometimes, medicines may be used, but it isn't known how much they help. If medicines are used, they are started right away. Common medicines are: Corticosteroids, which may reduce swelling around the facial nerve Medicines such as valacyclovir to fight the virus that may be causing Bell palsy Surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve (decompression surgery) has not been shown to benefit most people with Bell palsy.  Most people who have Bell palsy recover completely, without treatment, in several months Some people who have severe Bell palsy and can't move one side of their face at all may not recover fully If youve had symptoms for less than 48 hours, doctors may give you medicine called a corticosteroid that can make full recovery even more likely If you cannot close your eye all the way, your doctor may give you eye drops or a patch to protect your eye from drying out too much ",

            "knowledge": "Bladder control training may help you get better control of your bladder. Your doctor may suggest you try the following:  Pelvic muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises) work the muscles that you use to stop urinating. Making these muscles stronger helps you hold urine in your bladder longer. Learn more about pelvic floor exercises and how to do them. Biofeedback uses sensors to make you aware of signals from your body. This may help you regain control over the muscles in your bladder and urethra. Biofeedback can be helpful when learning pelvic muscle exercises. Timed voiding may help you control your bladder. In timed voiding, you urinate on a set schedule, for example, every hour. You can slowly extend the time between bathroom trips. When timed voiding is combined with biofeedback and pelvic muscle exercises, you may find it easier to control urge and overflow incontinence. Lifestyle changes may help with incontinence. Losing weight, quitting smoking, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to alcohol, drinking less caffeine (found in coffee, tea, and many sodas), preventing constipation and avoiding lifting heavy objects may help with incontinence. Choosing water instead of other drinks and limiting drinks before bedtime may also help.  Besides bladder control training, you may want to talk with your doctor about other ways to help manage incontinence:- Medicines can help the bladder empty more fully during urination. Other drugs tighten muscles and can lessen leakage. - Some women find that using an estrogen vaginal cream may help relieve stress or urge incontinence. A low dose of estrogen cream is applied directly to the vaginal walls and urethral tissue. - A doctor may inject a substance that thickens the area around the urethra to help close the bladder opening. This can reduce stress incontinence in women. This treatment may need to be repeated. - Some women may be able to use a medical device, such as a urethral insert, a small disposable device inserted into the urethra. A pessary, a stiff ring inserted into the vagina, may help prevent leaking if you have a prolapsed bladder or vagina. - Nerve stimulation, which sends mild electric current to the nerves around the bladder that help control urination, may be another option. - Surgery can sometimes improve or cure incontinence if it's caused by a change in the position of the bladder or blockage due to an enlarged prostate.Even after treatment, some people still leak urine from time to time. There are bladder control products and other solutions, including adult diapers, furniture pads, urine deodorizing pills, and special skin cleansers that may make leaking urine bother you a little less.Visit the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases for more information on urinary incontinence in men and urinary incontinence in women.Read about this topic in Spanish.
